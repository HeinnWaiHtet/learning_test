requirements: 
data never leaves a region without
your explicit permission
• Proximity to customers: reduced latency
• Available services within a Region: new servicesand new features aren’t available 
in every Region
• Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

AWS Availability Zones
• Each region has many availability zones
(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
• ap-southeast-2a
• ap-southeast-2b
• ap-southeast-2c
• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more
discrete data centers with redundant power,
networking, and connectivity
• They’re separate from each other, so that
they’re isolated from disasters
• They’re connected with high bandwidth,
ultra-low latency networking
