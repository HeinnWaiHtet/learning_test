Backlinks are links from other websites that point to your website. 
They are an essential aspect of off-page SEO and can significantly 
impact your website's authority and rankings in search engine results. 
Here's an example of how you can create a backlink:

In this example:

Backlink from Another Website: Within the <header> section, 
there's a paragraph containing a link to another website (https://www.example.com) 
with the anchor text "Example.com". This serves as a backlink to the specified website. 
The rel="nofollow" attribute indicates to search engines that the link 
should not pass PageRank to the linked website. However, this attribute 
is not mandatory and can be omitted if you want to pass PageRank to the linked site.
When other websites link to your website, it signals to search engines that 
your content is valuable and authoritative, which can positively impact 
your website's search engine rankings. However, it's important to note that 
not all backlinks are created equal. Quality backlinks from authoritative and 
relevant websites are more valuable for SEO than low-quality or spammy backlinks.
