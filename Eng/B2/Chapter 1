migration and meeting with other cultures, 
and that is reflected in our cuisine..

Our food is very popular outside of Turkey 
as well. You've probably visited Turkish 
restaurants and tasted Turkish food in your country.

Many people seem to think Turkish food is 
all grilled meat and flat bread, but it's 
more diverse than that. Bulgur wheat is a 
staple ingredient for us and we use it to 
make pilafs. A sweet dish that we are very 
famous for is 'lokum' or 'Turkish delight.' 
It is made in many countries around the 
world, but be careful! Some places don't 
sell authentic 'lokum', and so you have to 
visit a special Turkish shop or restaurant.

It's absolutely delicious!
