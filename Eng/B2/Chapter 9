1. Adverbial phrases - Learn about confusing adverbs and adverbial phrases

Here's a tip!
In this lesson, we'll learn how to add more information about the way 
something is done - this could be its time, place, frequency or even your 
opinion on it! 

This kind of information can be added using adverbs (one word, often 
finishing in "-ly") and adverbial phrases (more than one word).

Adverb
She speaks quickly.

Adverbial phrase
He asks me questions all the time. 

Unfortunately, I can't accept your invitation.
I'll talk to you in a minute.
Unfortunately, in, a, minute

Once upon a time, there was an incredibly lazy boy.

once upon a time- a long time ago

"Once upon a time, there was an incredibly lazy boy."

Once upon a time...
Shall we read the story about the incredibly lazy boy? Guess what... 
it starts with "once upon a time". 😉
First, read through it carefully and focus on understanding the storyline.

An incredibly lazy boy
Part 1
Once upon a time, there was an incredibly lazy boy. He hardly moved. 
He just sat comfortably on the sofa with one leg gently touching the floor. 
Occasionally, he opened his mouth slightly to ask his parents for 
something to drink. Actually, he tried not to do it too often because 
then, annoyingly, he would need to go to the toilet, and it was 
definitely the kind of thing he considered exhausting.

One day his parents left him alone at home for the entire afternoon, and 
he found himself incredibly thirsty. He resisted the urge to drink with 
great determination until the point that he couldn’t put off the decision 
any longer and bravely made his way to the fridge.
“I can do it,” he desperately whispered to himself as he slowly stood up.

The boy was so lazy that he spent his days on the sofa. 
He felt so tired that he even avoided going to the toilet. One day 
he was so thirsty that he decided to stand up and get water from the fridge.

Part 2
“Surprisingly, the fridge seems further away than usual,” 
he angrily muttered under his breath.
After 10 minutes, as he reached the kitchen he quickly grabbed the 
wonderfully cool bottle of water from the fridge. 
As soon as he took his first sip, he started feeling amazingly energised. 
A feeling he hadn’t experienced in years. He felt even better after he 
walked to the toilet and back, ran around the garden, and 
climbed to the top of a tree. 
“I’m the king of the world”, he shouted at the top of his voice. 
And suddenly he realised that the less we do, the less we want to do. 
Actually, only by using energy can we create more energy. 

This experience got him to try new types of movement such as running in the garden. 
He discovered that he had more energy when he was physically active.

Adverbs everywhere!
The story is full of adverbs and adverbial phrases. Let's look at them more closely. 

He just sat comfortably on the sofa with one leg gently touching the floor.

Occasionally (Sometimes), he opened his mouth slightly (a little bit) 
to ask his parents for something to drink.

It was definitely the kind of thing he considered exhausting.

and he found himself 1. ......... thirsty.

“I can do it,” he desperately whispered to himself as he slowly stood up.

furiously - angrily

“I’m the king of the world”, he shouted at the top of his voice.
''At the top of your voice" means "very loudly".

So far you've learned...
When you want to add more information about when something happened, how 
it happened or what you thought of it, use adverbs and adverbial phrases.

Feel free to start with the ones you've just learned.
how something happened - "comfortably", "quickly" 
when something happened - "one day", "as soon as"
your personal thoughts - "annoyingly", "surprisingly"
how often - "occasionally"

Confusing adverbs and adverbial phrases
The meanings of some adverbs and adverbial phrases can be quite confusing.
Do you know what the differences between these pairs are? 
👉 "hard"  or "hardly"
👉 "late" or "lately"
👉  "near" or "nearly"
👉 "currently" or "actually"
👉  "in the end" or "at the end"

2. Past perfect continuous - Use the past perfect continuous

I had worked in a bank before I started university.
We use the past perfect ("I had worked") to talk about something 
that happened before another event in the past.


She had visited Peru before she went last summer.
You hadn't been dating for long when you got engaged.
"You hadn't been dating for long" and "you got engaged" are 
two events that occurred in the past.

 Which three verbs indicate a past action that continued until 
 another past action happened?
She had been waiting for hours when the bus finally arrived.
has been waiting

Here's a tip! 💡
Generally, we can use the past perfect ("I had studied") and 
the past perfect continuous ("I had been studying") to talk about events 
that occurred before another time or event in the past.
However, if you want to distinguish between a past action that was 
in progress leading up to another past action, you can use the past 
perfect continuous tense to show this.
You can also use this tense to emphasise the duration of a past event.

They'd been hiking all day when they reached the summit.
A past action was in progress leading up to another past action.

We'd been working hard on the project for over a month.
A past action was in progress for a duration of time.
 
The system had been operating just fine before it got hacked.
This sentence uses the past perfect continuous tense 
(had + been + present participle "operating").

I had read the original novel. - Past perfect
They had been hiking for hours. - Past perfect continuous

"We had already been discussing the project before the meeting started." 
Select the correct option:
We were discussing the project before the meeting.

They'd been ignoring my calls all day yesterday.

"I had been exercising at home for a year when I finally joined a gym." 
Select the correct option:
I joined a gym after exercising at home for a year.

Great job so far! 💪
We've looked at how to put together a sentence using the past perfect continuous.

Did you know that we can use time stamps (e.g. before, when, until, for) 
to introduce another past action or to specify the duration of an event?

Let's have a look at some examples!
I had been jogging for an hour when I injured my knee.
Alex had been waiting all day before he decided to cancel the meeting.
The program had been working well until February.

Tina had been managing the team until she got promoted.
Had you been waiting for a long time ?

Mary had realised her mistake before it was too late.
The verb "to realise" is a mental state so we use the past perfect tense.

He had been making food all day and the kitchen was a mess.
The verb "to make" could be considered a continuous action 
in this case with the time stamp "all day".

Selfies had existed long before social media made them a trend.
The verb "to exist" is a stative verb that is generally not used 
in the continuous aspect.

Kyle had been drinking soya milk the entire time.
The verb "to drink" could be considered a continuous action 
in this case with the time stamp "the entire time".

an action that was in progress leading up to another action in the past
Nick had been working from home for the past six months.

We had been surfing for three hours by the time it got dark.
Had Paul been taking care of his back before the accident?
The ground was still wet as it had been raining throughout the night.
Clearly, I had not been paying enough attention to the instructor.
Anna had been going to the gym regularly.
Chris had been driving for several hours and was sleepy.
Wendy hadn't been drinking enough water and felt very thirsty.

3. Verb patterns in creative texts - Focus on verbs that are followed by "-ing" and "to" + infinitive

What happens when you have two verbs in a sentence?
In this lesson, we're going to read some creative writing and 
we'll focus on how verbs interact with each other.

Sometimes they just don't react and are happily next to each other 
without any change like in "I should leave as soon as possible".
However, that's the case mainly for modal verbs (verbs such as "should", 
"can", "must", "might" or "will".)

Here are two ways that verbs interact:

adding "-ing" to the second verb
I recommend ordering a cheese board

adding "to" before the second verb in the infinitive
I want to take a course on creative writing.

to pretend to
She pretended not to see me.

to manage to
I managed to complete the report on time.

to appear to
She appears to feel very upset.

"Pretend", "manage", "appear" are similar in that they are followed 
by "to" + infinitive.

can't afford to
We can't afford to buy a new car now.

to promise to
She promised to help me with my homework.

to regret
I regret sending this message to my ex-boyfriend.

How is "regret" different from "can't afford" and "promise"?
It is followed by "-ing".

Here's a tip!
If you're looking for a pattern to figure out what verbs make 
the second verb take "-ing" or "to" + infinitive, you'll be disappointed 
to learn there are no rules - these verbs need to be learned. 😰
But hey, it's not all bad news as you've already learned quite a lot of them. 👍🏽

"-ing"
regret

"to" + infinitive
can't afford
promise
pretend
manage
appear

I managed to have a conversation in Japanese.

Let's see verbs in context !
Reading is a great way to see verbs in action and notice how they 
interact with each other. Now, you'll read a short piece of creative writing.

As you read, think about the type of creative writing it is. 🕵🏼
Vocabulary 

to brew (v) - add boiling water to make a drink 
a gaze (n) - a long look
engrossed (adj) - engaged, absorbed
to cherish (v) - protect and care for

Purple unicorns
Janine was sitting at the kitchen table drinking a cup of freshly brewed coffee. 
She pretended to be reading the newspaper because she didn’t want her 
daughter Molly to notice her and be distracted by her gaze. 
Molly appeared to be so happily engrossed in her game that Janine 
promised to cherish moments like these and never interrupt them.

Molly was sitting near the sofa playing with two purple unicorns she 
managed to convince Janine last night she "really, really needed". 
Even though these two purple unicorns are not something that Janine 
could afford to buy, given that she was three months behind on her rent, 
she didn’t regret getting them for Molly.

What kind of creative writing is it?
a novel

Why did Janine decide to not interrupt her daughter's game?
