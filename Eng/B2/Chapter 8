1. Making deductions - Make deductions about the past

Who remembers modal verbs?
We use modal verbs (words like "must", "might", "could") to express 
necessity, possibility or probability.

We can use modal verbs to talk about how sure we are that something is 
true or not, and make deductions about the past and present.

must - indicates certainty (+)
can't - indicates certainty (-)
could, might, may - indicates possibility, but with some doubt

"It must be true!" - I am sure it's true.
"It could be true..." - There's a possibility that it's true.
"It can't be true!" - I am sure it's not true.

Rik can't be online now, he's in Australia and it's 3am there.
Using the modal verb "can't" indicates that the speaker is sure his statement is not true.

My notifications must be turned off, I didn't know about the email.

Which sentence expresses the least certainty?
My card details could be incorrect.

My payment must have failed. I haven't received a confirmation email.

They might have hacked my account; I don't recognise the recent transactions.

She can't have lost her card, she used it this morning.

Making deductions in the past
When we want to make deductions about past events, we use the following 
construction:<br><br>"can't/must/might/could" + "have" + past participle 
("failed", "hacked", "lost")

My payment must have failed = I'm sure that my payment failed.
They might have hacked his account. = It's possible that they hacked his account.
She can't have lost her card. = I'm sure that she hasn't lost her card.

The update can't have failed.
She is making a comment about an update that happened in the past ("can't have failed").

The new update might have caused issues. - deduction about the past
The new update might be causing issues. - deduction about the present

the deduction about a past event.
You must have restarted your computer.

"My laptop might have broken." - It's possible that my laptop's broken.
"My laptop can't have broken." - I'm sure my laptop isn't broken.
"My laptop must have broken." - I'm sure my laptop's broken.

Rephrase this into a deduction about a past action: "She could forget her password."
She could have forgotten her password.

What does Carmen think about the booking site she used?
She is sure that it wasn't secure.

That booking site can't have been very secure!

Good job so far! üí™
We've learned about expressing certainty and possibility about present and past events. 
Let's quickly review the constructions, before we practise making deductions ourselves!

Joseph could be online now. 
Joseph could have been online last night.
expresses possibility about Joseph's activity online

The store can't close at midnight.
The store can't have closed at midnight. 
expresses certainty about the closing time of the online store

She must be able to pay on the app. 
She must have been able to pay on the app. 
expresses certainty about app payment options

Select the words that express certainty.
can't, must

The store might have closed, no one is answering the phone.

express certainty in the present .
Greg must be at home, that's his car.

Elio: I think I might've accidentally suspended my online banking account. 
I can't log in anymore, it says "account cannot be located".
Rachel: Hmm, that's odd. Your username might be incorrect. 
Could you have changed it recently and forgotten?
Elio: No, I can't have changed it recently, 
I haven't used the app for a couple of months.
Rachel: You must've typed the details incorrectly. 
If you haven't used it for months, it's likely you haven't changed anything.
Elio: But someone could've hacked the account and changed the details.
Rachel: Surely not! Banks usually contact customers when there is suspicious activity.
Elio: You never know, this hacker might be very good at imitating me! 
I'll give the bank a call just to be sure.

Did you notice?
When speaking, we often merge the modal verb and "have" together to create 
"must've", "could've", "might've". We put more emphasis on the modal verb, 
which is why we produce the weak form of "have" when speaking. üó£Ô∏è

I might've accidentally suspended my online banking account.
You must've typed the details incorrectly.
Someone could've hacked the account.

Elio thinks it's possible he suspended his account.

Rephrase this into a deduction about a present action: 
"I might have suspended my online banking account."
I might suspend my online banking account.

Your username might be|could be incorrect.
Could you have changed your username recently?
No, I can't have|cannot have changed it recently.
You can't have typed the details correctly.

Rephrase this into a deduction about a past action: 
"But someone could hack my account."
But someone could have hacked|could've hacked my account.

You never know, this hacker might be very good at imitating me!

something we are reading or listening to. üí° We take notes for various 
reasons: we might be listening to a lecture at university, in an important 
meeting at work, or studying at home.

Generally, the notes we take are short and concise to make it easier for 
us to remember the main ideas. We can use "bullet points", like below: 

Facebook:
