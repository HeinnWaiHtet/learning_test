1. Describing urban spaces - Learn about Toronto

Welcome!
We're going to learn about Queen Street West, a neighbourhood in Toronto, Canada. 🏙️ 🇨🇦

First, we'll explore some new language, and then we'll watch a video. Let's get started!

gentrified
The neighbourhood of Queen Street West has been gentrified in the last few years.

Gentrification 🏠
We often say that an area has been gentrified when people invest in new shops, 
restaurants and housing there.

A gentrified area will usually be more expensive than it was before.

sketchy
We say an area is "sketchy" when it is unsafe.

I wouldn't go to a sketchy neighbourhood at night.
"Sketchy" means "unsafe".

gritty
We use "gritty" to describe something with somewhat unpleasant features.

My neighbourhood has a gritty past.
"Gritty" means "somewhat unpleasant".

sketchy - unsafe
gritty - somewhat unpleasant

an artist's hub
Queen Street West is an artist's hub.

Here's a tip!

We use the word "hub" to talk about a place with a lot of activity.
An "artist's hub" 🧑‍🎨 is where lots of artists live and work, and a 
"financial hub" is where lots of banks are situated. 💵

Queen Street West is an artist's hub.

Singapore is a notable financial hub.

My neighbourhood is definitely an artist's hub.

Which adjective describes an area that has changed and become more expensive?
gentrified

Let's watch the video! ▶️
We're going to watch a video featuring shop owners in Queen West Street, 
Toronto. Listen for the words we've seen in their descriptions of the area! 👂

gentrified (adj) - changed and become more expensive
sketchy (adj) - unsafe
gritty (adj) - with somewhat unpleasant features
an artist's hub (n) - a place where lots of artists live and work

Queen Street West has changed a lot in recent years.
There are new shops, apartments and restaurants.
Queen Street West has a somewhat unpleasant past.

You get...
In the video we heard that "you get..." can be another way to say "there is/there are". 👍

"You get clothing stores you don't find other places in the city." 
= "There are clothing stores you don't find other places in the city."

"Moving in" and "going up"
The shop owners use phrasal verbs "move in" and "go up" to describe the 
changing neighbourhood.

A lot of stores are moving in - A lot of stores are arriving in the area.
All the new condos...going up across the street. 
- New condos (apartments) are being built.

I wouldn’t really know how to identify the neighbourhood 
because of all the new condos that are literally going up across the street.

I would say in the last 10 to 5 years it’s really developed and 
a lot of stores are moving in.

you get - there is/are
moving in - arriving
going up - being built

"You come down here and there’s still a bit of that sketchiness, which we kinda like..."
"Sketchiness" is the noun form of "sketchy".

Well done!
We've learned some ways to describe urban areas and how they change. 🌆
Next time we will work on expressing our opinions on these changes.

Design, with a gritty past

The New York Times

After decades of industrial shifts and 
urban decay, more than a mile of the road 
called Queen Street West, is now home to 
Toronto’s art and design district.

“If you're anti-mall essentially...that’s 
sort of what it is. You get clothing stores 
you don’t find other places in the city, 
you get restaurants you don’t find...people 
who want something different, they don’t 
want something, you know, as a franchise, 
they’ll come to this part of town.”

“We’re in my shop, CryWolf, me and my friend 
Rose own it. We have our screen printed t 
shirts, that’s kinda our main thing now. We 
came up with a few ideas to start and 
started printing on shirts. It’s pretty much 
a collaborative effort. This used to be a 
street, that, um, I wouldn’t even go to. I 
would say in the last 10 to 5 years it’s 
really developed and a lot of stores are 
moving in. It’s the place to be! Definitely 
the place to be.”

In a super heated real estate market, 
Queen West residents embrace speciality shops, 
farm-to-table cuisine, and loft apartments, 
while regretting the flight of artists and 
the loss of affordable housing.

“Queen west west has sort of been an 
artist’s hub, I’d say it’s gentrified quite 
a bit. I wouldn’t really know how to 
identify the neighborhood because of all the 
new condos that are literally going up 
across the street. 
It’s changing drastically. 
There’s still some art background 
and culture, and things like that here,
but i’d say there’s a lot of traffic 
because of all the shops and things like that. 
We have a lot of designers that come in, 
and the regular clients, um, we also do 
interior plant-scaping.”

“You- you know I’ve often mentioned 
shows like Mad Men that have furniture very 
similar to what we do. We were founded 
in 2000, so it’s been 14 years. 
Um, when we first opened the neighborhood 
was a little on the sketchy side…”

The neighborhood still has echoes of its 
gritty history in the form of a large drug 
treatment facility, but many people say they 
like it that way.

“As more successful businesses have grown, 
other people have followed suit and, you 
know, you know. You come down here and 
there’s still a bit of that sketchiness, 
which we kinda like, I mean, you know we’re 
not tryna make it super clean and boring 
that way, but yeah. It’s definitely got its 
own unique flavour, which, we’re big fans of.”

4. Language recap - Review of recent lessons

Welcome to this review lesson!

In this review lesson we are going to read about a neighbourhood in Warsaw, Poland. 
🇵🇱 We'll also practise the language we've learned to talk about urban change.

Before we start, take a look at the phrase below.
an up-and-coming neighbourhood 🏘️ - an area that is becoming more popular

Praga, Warsaw 🇵🇱
***************
The neighbourhood of Praga, East Warsaw, has transformed in recent years. It 
has a gritty history, and used to be famous for its high crime rate. Now, many 
students and artists are moving in because they can rent cheap apartments 
there. Praga is now considered an up-and-coming neighbourhood, with many new 
bars, shops and clubs.

Not all residents of Praga are fans of these changes. They want to preserve 
the history of the neighbourhood. It was one of the only neighbourhoods to 
escape damage in the Second World War. The residents like their neighbourhood 
the way it is.

somewhat unpleasant - gritty

Now, many students and artists are moving in.
"Up-and-coming" means "becoming more popular".

Not all residents of Praga are fans of these changes.
The residents like their neighbourhood the way it is.

Jakub
I was reading about Praga recently. Apparently it's changing drastically. 
You get bars there you don't find in the centre of Warsaw. Have you been?

Ewa
Yeah, my aunt lives in Praga. She's really not a fan of all the students 
coming to the area. She says it's become too busy.

Jakub
I'd say that gentrification is a good thing. 
I've heard that the neighbourhood used to be quite dangerous.

Ewa
Yes, but the change is difficult for the people who live there. 
Some of the old factories have become clubs and so it is very busy at night.

Jakub
The way I see it, it's great that businesses move into old neighbourhoods to create more jobs.

Ewa
Maybe. But the residents might like their neighbourhood the way it is.

5. Developing fluency - Describe change in your neighbourhood

It's your turn!
In this lesson you will have the chance to tell the Busuu Community 
what you think about changes in your neighbourhood. 🌆
First, we will find out about the experiences of Adriana in Brazil and Jack in England.

Pinheiros, São Paulo 🇧🇷
I've lived in Pinheiros all my life, and it's changed drastically. 
Many new businesses have moved in, and I'd say the neighbourhood looks and 
feels completely different to when I was a child. 
The new shops and restaurants have created new jobs for residents, 
and the way I see it, this can only be a good thing. 
It's still my home, but it's a more interesting place than it was before.

Portreath, Cornwall 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
***********
I moved to Portreath 10 years ago. When I first arrived, 
the town was very quiet and peaceful, I knew all of my neighbours. 
However, in recent years, large holiday apartments have gone up and 
now it's very busy in summer. I'm not anti-change, 
but I am also not a fan of places that become drastically different 
because of the tourists. Everything is more expensive now.
