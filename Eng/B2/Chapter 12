The body
1. Learning sign language - Learn how signers use their body to communicate

Sign language🦻
It's believed that body language accounts for 60% of what we communicate. 
But it's nothing compared to the importance of the body in sign language.
In this lesson, we'll learn vocabulary to describe body movements, 
facial expressions, and gestures while exploring the incredible American 
Sign Language (ASL). 🤚✋🖐️

a palm facing in
In ASL, numbers one through five are generally done with a palm facing in.

to stroke your chin
Stroking the chin with the thumb and fingers on opposite sides of 
the chin means “beard” in American Sign Language.

Your chin is a part of your face.
Your palm is a part of your hand.

He stroked his beard thoughtfully.

to tap your nose
Tapping your nose is part of saying “don’t mind” in ASL.

She tapped her nose.
She hit her nose with her fingers very gently.

What is the speaker's main point?
Sign languages are way more complex than generally believed.

location - stroking your chin
palm orientation - palm facing in
non-manual signals - facial expressions

to tilt your head
To sign a question, tilt your head slightly forward.

to shake your head
In many sign languages, shaking your head means "no".

She shook her head. - She moved her head backwards and forwards quickly.
She tilted her head. - She moved her head to one side.

to raise your eyebrows
In ASL, you show surprise by raising the eyebrows.

to furrow your brows
Signers furrow their brows when they ask questions.
Jill raised an eyebrow but did not comment.

to lean forward/back
To say "always" in ASL, you need to lean your body forward.

to lean - your body forward
to stroke - your chin
to furrow - your brows

Welcome back! 👋
In this part of the lesson, we'll learn 
1️⃣ vocabulary for some body parts 
2️⃣ how to sign some easy words
3️⃣ about grammar in ASL 

Have you ever wondered how grammar is communicated in sign language? 
Contrary to popular belief, it’s not that much with hand shapes but 
rather with non-manual markers where hands are not involved at all. 
Here are some examples of how ASL signers convey grammatical information.

Yes/No questions
When signing a question that can be answered "yes or no", 
you raise your eyebrows and tilt your head forward a bit.

"Wh-" questions
Questions such as "who", "what", "when" or "how" are signed with the 
"wh" facial expression. Furrow the eyebrows a bit and tilt the head slightly back while you lean the body forward a bit.

Negation
To express negation in ASL, shake your head and furrow your brows.

In ASL, grammar is conveyed with facial expressions and head movements.

yes/no question - move your head gently forward
"wh-" question - move your body slightly forward
negation - move your head quickly

To answer a "yes/no" question, raise your eyebrows and tilt your head forward.

Try to furrow your eyebrows a bit to sign a "wh-" question.
If you want to ask "why" in ASL, lean your body forward.

Here's a tip!

Before we finish, we're going to learn how to sign three words in ASL. 
Let's learn which body parts we will need to sign them! 

a chest
a forehead
a thumb
an index finger

a chest
To sign "white", move your hand away from the chest while pulling all fingers together.

a forehead
To say "think", move your finger in a small circle in front of the forehead.

a chest - front of the upper body
a forehead - front of the head

a thumb
To do the sign for "fine", touch your thumb to your chest.

an index finger
To do the sign for "black", take your index finger and draw it across your brow.

a thumb - the short, thick finger on your hand
an index finger - the finger next to the short, thick finger

To sign "I love you", point out your thumb and index finger to form an “L”.

Which body part is involved in signing all these three words?
thumb

Rub your hand in a circle on your chest.
Touch your chin and extend your index finger.

Final recap ✨
The body can, amazingly, be everything you need to communicate 
effectively just like 70 million deaf people around the world do every 
day in more than 300 different sign languages.🤯 Here's a recap of the 
vocabulary to describe how signers communicate.

👉my palm faces in/out
👉to stroke your chin
👉to tap your nose
👉to tilt your head
👉to shake your head
👉to raise your brows
👉to furrow your brows 
👉to lean your body forward/back

3. Silent letters - Practise pronouncing words with silent letters

Silent letters 🔇
By now, you must have noticed that English words are often spelled 
differently from how they sound!

In this lesson, we'll look at two silent letters 
(letters in a word that we don't sound when speaking).

We'll start with words for body parts and try to identify what letters are silent. 🔎 🔇 🔤

wrist
wrinkles
palm
calf

a wrist
I love the bracelet you're wearing on your wrist.

wrinkles
Smoking can cause premature wrinkles.

"W" is silent in the "wr" combination.

She sprayed the perfume on her wrist and smelled it.

the words with a silent "w".
wrap, wrinkle, writer, wrist

I have to wrap all these Christmas presents.

I think you've written my name wrong.

Silent letters
We've already identified the silent "w" in words such as "wrist" or "wrinkles" 
but we're still on the lookout for one more silent letter. 🔎 Let's go! 

a palm
My palms are sweating.

a calf
I always stretch my calves before going for a run.

The letter "l" is silent in these words.
half, palm, calf, salmon, calm, would, could

"L" is silent when it's between a vowel (e.g. a, o, u, e) and 
a consonant (e.g. m, f, d).

If you're feeling cold, rub your palms together.
This calf pain is unbearable.
Would you like some salmon?
Could you please keep calm?
