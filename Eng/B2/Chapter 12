The body
1. Learning sign language - Learn how signers use their body to communicate

Sign languageü¶ª
It's believed that body language accounts for 60% of what we communicate. 
But it's nothing compared to the importance of the body in sign language.
In this lesson, we'll learn vocabulary to describe body movements, 
facial expressions, and gestures while exploring the incredible American 
Sign Language (ASL). ü§ö‚úãüñêÔ∏è

a palm facing in
In ASL, numbers one through five are generally done with a palm facing in.

to stroke your chin
Stroking the chin with the thumb and fingers on opposite sides of 
the chin means ‚Äúbeard‚Äù in American Sign Language.

Your chin is a part of your face.
Your palm is a part of your hand.

He stroked his beard thoughtfully.

to tap your nose
Tapping your nose is part of saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mind‚Äù in ASL.

She tapped her nose.
She hit her nose with her fingers very gently.

What is the speaker's main point?
Sign languages are way more complex than generally believed.

location - stroking your chin
palm orientation - palm facing in
non-manual signals - facial expressions

to tilt your head
To sign a question, tilt your head slightly forward.

to shake your head
In many sign languages, shaking your head means "no".

She shook her head. - She moved her head backwards and forwards quickly.
She tilted her head. - She moved her head to one side.

to raise your eyebrows
In ASL, you show surprise by raising the eyebrows.

to furrow your brows
Signers furrow their brows when they ask questions.
Jill raised an eyebrow but did not comment.

to lean forward/back
To say "always" in ASL, you need to lean your body forward.

to lean - your body forward
to stroke - your chin
to furrow - your brows

Welcome back! üëã
In this part of the lesson, we'll learn 
1Ô∏è‚É£ vocabulary for some body parts 
2Ô∏è‚É£ how to sign some easy words
3Ô∏è‚É£ about grammar in ASL 

Have you ever wondered how grammar is communicated in sign language? 
Contrary to popular belief, it‚Äôs not that much with hand shapes but 
rather with non-manual markers where hands are not involved at all. 
Here are some examples of how ASL signers convey grammatical information.

Yes/No questions
When signing a question that can be answered "yes or no", 
you raise your eyebrows and tilt your head forward a bit.

"Wh-" questions
Questions such as "who", "what", "when" or "how" are signed with the 
"wh" facial expression. Furrow the eyebrows a bit and tilt the head slightly back while you lean the body forward a bit.

Negation
To express negation in ASL, shake your head and furrow your brows.

In ASL, grammar is conveyed with facial expressions and head movements.

yes/no question - move your head gently forward
"wh-" question - move your body slightly forward
negation - move your head quickly

To answer a "yes/no" question, raise your eyebrows and tilt your head forward.

Try to furrow your eyebrows a bit to sign a "wh-" question.
If you want to ask "why" in ASL, lean your body forward.

Here's a tip!

Before we finish, we're going to learn how to sign three words in ASL. 
Let's learn which body parts we will need to sign them! 

a chest
a forehead
a thumb
an index finger

a chest
To sign "white", move your hand away from the chest while pulling all fingers together.

a forehead
To say "think", move your finger in a small circle in front of the forehead.

a chest - front of the upper body
a forehead - front of the head

a thumb
To do the sign for "fine", touch your thumb to your chest.

an index finger
To do the sign for "black", take your index finger and draw it across your brow.

a thumb - the short, thick finger on your hand
an index finger - the finger next to the short, thick finger

To sign "I love you", point out your thumb and index finger to form an ‚ÄúL‚Äù.

Which body part is involved in signing all these three words?
thumb

Rub your hand in a circle on your chest.
Touch your chin and extend your index finger.

Final recap ‚ú®
The body can, amazingly, be everything you need to communicate 
effectively just like 70 million deaf people around the world do every 
day in more than 300 different sign languages.ü§Ø Here's a recap of the 
vocabulary to describe how signers communicate.

üëâmy palm faces in/out
üëâto stroke your chin
üëâto tap your nose
üëâto tilt your head
üëâto shake your head
üëâto raise your brows
üëâto furrow your brows 
üëâto lean your body forward/back

2. The senses - Describe experiences with verbs of the senses

Here's a tip!

In this lesson, we'll follow Rachel, who is trying to find a date on a dating app. 
üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë© Look at the two women the dating app suggests as a good match for her. 
Is she going to swipe left or right? ‚¨ÖÔ∏è üì± ‚û°Ô∏è

She is similar to my neighbour.

She looks like she likes spending time with people.
she looks like + verb phrase

She looks like she likes spending time with people - It's my impression.
She likes spending time with people. - It's a fact.

Here's a tip!
When we describe something using verbs such as "to look", "to smell", 
"to taste" or "to feel", we can use them in three ways. 

1Ô∏è‚É£ She looks friendly.
looks + adjective

2Ô∏è‚É£ It looks like cheese.
looks like + a noun

3Ô∏è‚É£ It looks like you've cooked it too long.

June's hands feel soft.
to feel + adjective

It feels like we've known each other forever.
to feel like + verb phrase

As if
Instead of "like + verb phrase" you can use "as if + verb phrase"

It feels like we've known each other forever. 
It feels as if we've known each other forever. 

June looks as if she wants to continue the walk. I think she's enjoying the date.

Which body part do you need to do these?

to look - eyes
to smell - nose
to feel - hands or heart

Let's take the other path. It smells like someone is smoking in here.

They bump into Rachel's friend and his dog. 
Go on, June. Touch it! Its fur feels super smooth.

Then they go for a drink.
My beer tastes like it's been out of the fridge for an hour.

 what Rachel thinks of her beer.

where other English speakers will give you feedback. You can do it! ‚≠ê

Try using the language we've looked at in this lesson.

It looks/smells/feels/ tastes great (adjective).
It looks/smells/feels/tastes like cheese (noun).
It looks/smells/feels/tastes like/as if you've just bought it (verb phrase).

3. Silent letters - Practise pronouncing words with silent letters

Silent letters üîá
By now, you must have noticed that English words are often spelled 
differently from how they sound!

In this lesson, we'll look at two silent letters 
(letters in a word that we don't sound when speaking).

We'll start with words for body parts and try to identify what letters are silent. üîé üîá üî§

wrist
wrinkles
palm
calf

a wrist
I love the bracelet you're wearing on your wrist.

wrinkles
Smoking can cause premature wrinkles.

"W" is silent in the "wr" combination.

He's worried because he started developing some wrinkles recently.
She sprayed the perfume on her wrist and smelled it.

the words with a silent "w".
wrap, wrinkle, writer, wrist

I have to wrap all these Christmas presents.

I think you've written my name wrong.

Silent letters
We've already identified the silent "w" in words such as "wrist" or "wrinkles" 
but we're still on the lookout for one more silent letter. üîé Let's go! 

a palm
My palms are sweating.

a calf
I always stretch my calves before going for a run.

The letter "l" is silent in these words.
half, palm, calf, salmon, calm, would, could

"L" is silent when it's between a vowel (e.g. a, o, u, e) and 
a consonant (e.g. m, f, d).

If you're feeling cold, rub your palms together.
This calf pain is unbearable.
Would you like some salmon?
Could you please keep calm?

What kind of training can the employees at this company most benefit from?
safety at work

The training will mainly focus on how to safely set up 
your workstation and handle heavy objects.

a workstation set-up
the way your equipment and furniture at work are organised

manual handling
pulling, putting down or carrying heavy objects

Rishi:
To start with, let me mention the importance of 
proper manual handling. In our company, most of us 
carry, lift and put down things all the time and if 
it's not done properly, you can experience injuries.

That brings me to the fact that this year alone, 
various injuries have been reported in our company. 
Two colleagues sprained their wrists, one bruised 
her arm, three got their fingers trapped between a 
load and a wall, one had broken bones and two 
colleagues pulled muscles.

These numbers are disappointing and we have to 
closely follow our safety measures to avoid such incidents.

How does Rishi feel about safety in the company?
He's not happy about this year's accident records.

This year, in Rishi's company some colleagues 
sprained their wrists, bruised their arms and broke their bones

Rishi:
Let me move on to the ergonomics of our work. 
Since many of us starting working mainly from home, 
we have noticed a significant increase in people 
complaining about back, neck, arm and hip pain. The 
main reason for that is a poor work station set-up. 
We have employees who admit to working from a couch 
or an armchair or using a laptop as opposed to a desktop.

What is the main point Rishi is making?
Remote working has contributed to a lot of injuries.

Which pieces of equipment or furniture are not ergonomic?
laptop, armchair, couch

You slept in a very uncomfortable bed. 
It hurts when you move your head. What do you say?
I'm experiencing neck pain.

You hit your arm against a wall and now you have 
a mark there. What do you say?
I've bruised my arm.

You were trying to close the door and 
your fingers got caught and it hurt a lot. 
What do you say?
I trapped my fingers in the door.

Final recap ü§ï
We hope your workplace is safe, üë∑ü•Ω and you don't 
find yourself having to use these expressions too 
much to talk about your own experience. üòâ

Before you finish, look again at the vocabulary 
you learned in this lesson. 

to bruise your arm 
to break a bone
to sprain your wrist
to pull a muscle
to trap your fingers
back injuries
neck pain

‚úîÔ∏èthree nearly pulled their muscles.

This is not a good record and we have to closely 
follow our safety measures to avoid such incidents.

What words does he use to introduce his first point?
"To start with" is used to introduce the first point.

to start with
To start with, neck pain is the number one complaint among our employees.

"To start with" has a similar meaning to "first of all".

Safety at work
Part 3

Since many of us started working mainly from home, 
we have noticed a significant increase in people complaining about back, neck, arm and hip pain. 
The main reason for that is a poor workstation set-up. 
We have employees who admit to working from a couch or an armchair, 
or using a laptop as opposed to a desktop.

That brings me to the point that broken bones 
are the most common injury in our company.

That brings me to the point that broken bones 
are the most common injury in our company.

Safety at work
Part 5
Let me finish by saying that we spend an awful lot 
of time at work and we should always take our safety 
seriously. That‚Äôs why I encourage you to apply 
everything you‚Äôll learn about safety measures in this course. 

What words does he use to conclude his presentation?
Let me finish by saying...
