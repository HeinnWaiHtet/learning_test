Reported speech

When we want to report somebody's original words we:
👉🏽 change future and present forms to past forms. 🔙
👉🏽 change past forms to past perfect. 🔙 

Direct speech 
"I will never star in a rom-com."
"I'm on the cover of the magazine." 
"We're shooting a film." 
"I've broken up with my girlfriend."
"I was only talking to him, we're not a couple." 
"The director personally chose the cast." 

Indirect speech 
She said she would never star in a rom-com.

🛎️ Watch out for exceptions! 🛎️
In some situations, we don't need to change the verb form when we use indirect speech.

For example: 
👉 when we report something immediately after it happens and it's still true

What did she just say? She said she's going home.  
👉 when we report a general truth 

The teacher said that wolves live in packs. 
👉 after verbs and verbal phrases that don't have past forms such as "might", 
"would", "should", "had better", "used to", "could", "mustn't"

The actor said he might audition for the role. 

"The actress said Antarctica is covered with ice."
It's a general truth. 

"The director said he feels disappointed with the Academy's decision."
Why is there no verb change in this indirect sentence?
It's reported immediately after he says it and it's still true.

Choose the verbs that don't change in indirect speech.
You should go to the doctor.
I might stop acting for a while.
should go, might

Must and mustn't
While "mustn't" doesn't change its form "must" can change to "had to" 
when we talk about obligation.

must 
She said, "I must believe in myself more." → She said she had to/must believe in herself more. 

mustn't 
She said, " I mustn't worry about my career." → She said she mustn't worry about her career. 

1. "They said they must try harder." 2. "They said they had to try harder."
Both sentences are correct.

Pam said she was trying to focus on the positive and that 
she shouldn't be bothered by nasty comments.

She said she had wanted to keep the divorce private but then she had decided to speak out.

She also said we had better|'d better bring visibility to the issue.
We use "had better" as strong advice if we believe there will be 
negative consequences for not doing something.

She said she was going to take some time off and she would continue working on her beauty products.
She also said we might not hear much from her.

3. Reading news reports - Read some news - including material from The Economist

Thorny case: fruit sabotage in Australia
This is the title of an article about a particular fruit 
that was contaminated (made unhealthy to eat) in Australia in 2018.

Which fruit do you think was contaminated ? 🍌🍇🍏🍒
Let's read the first sentence of the article to see if your guess was correct.

Thorny case: fruit sabotage in Australia

The Economist
Fruit growers lost millions of dollars when needles inexplicably started 
appearing inside strawberries this September.

© 2018 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved. Published 
under licence. The original article can be found on: www.economist.com

This article is about strawberries being contaminated in Australian farms.

"Fruit growers lost millions of dollars when needles inexplicably 
started appearing inside strawberries."
Farmers lost a lot of money as a result of the contamination.
Nobody could explain (it was "inexplicable") how the needles got inside the strawberries.

The title of this article is a pun (a play on words with a double meaning). 😮
A thorny case describes a problem or difficult situation, 
much like the one in this story!

However, this phrase also has a literal meaning based on the context of this article: 
"thorny" relates to sharpness (in this case the needles)🪡 and 
"case" can mean a container 🧺, like the punnets (boxes) of strawberries. 🍓

So, the news title refers to both "a difficult situation" and 
"a box of sharp objects".

Here are some more words that appear in the article. ⤵️
thorny (adj) – causing a problem or difficulty / sharp
to contaminate / to spike something (v) – to make something unsafe to eat
to sabotage (v) – to destroy or damage something
a needle (n) –  a pointy object with a sharp end
inexplicably (adv) – without a reason or explanation
a hoax (n) – a lie, a trick or a fake claim
a copycat (n) – a person who imitates someone's behaviour or image

Thorny case: fruit sabotage in Australia
The Economist
Fruit growers lost millions of dollars when needles inexplicably 
started appearing inside strawberries this September. 
The first case was recorded in Queensland, when an unfortunate shopper 
found a surprise inside his snack. Within days, copycats had contaminated 
punnets across the country, prompting supermarkets to pull strawberries 
(and sewing needles) from their shelves. Police received a total of 186 
reports of spiked fruit, although a few turned out to be hoaxes.

Today the first person to be charged for those crimes appeared at a court 
in Brisbane. Fifty year old My Ut Trinh was a supervisor at one of the 
affected farms and waged a pointed campaign “motivated by spite or 
revenge”, the Crown alleges. The offence would normally carry a three-year 
sentence, but the furore prompted the passage of a more punitive law on 
food tampering. If she is found guilty, Ms Trinh could spend a decade 
behind bars.

Shoppers found sewing needles inside the strawberries they had bought.

In Queensland, an unfortunate customer discovered the strawberries 
he bought contained needles.
The word "unfortunate" refers to having bad luck. 
"Inexplicable" refers to something that cannot be explained.

"Within days, copycats had contaminated punnets across the country."
A "copycat" imitates someone's behaviour or image.

"made something unsafe to eat". - contaminated

a hoax - a trick or a fake claim is to say it's...
He pretended his horse was a unicorn. The whole story was a hoax!

"Police received a total of 186 reports of spiked fruit, although 
a few turned out to be hoaxes."
* Only "a few" turned out to be fake.

"to stop selling a product and remove them from the store" is...
to pull (stock) from the shelves
Supermarkets pulled strawberries and needles from the shelves.

They removed all strawberries and sewing needles from their stores.

"boxes" or "containers" for fruit.
Ms Trinh was charged with contaminating punnets of strawberries.

A farm supervisor was charged for starting a crime wave of 
inserting needles into strawberries.

Let's go deeper into the text! 👓
Newspaper editors use figures of speech (words that mean something 
different from their literal definition) that give the reader a stronger 
description, such as:

👉 a thorny case – a difficult situation
👉 to pull stock from the shelves – to stop selling something
👉 to wage a campaign – to start. an activity or protest

They also use synonyms (words with the same or similar meaning) to avoid 
repetition, like these below. ⤵️

farmers → fruit growers
to contaminate → to spike → to tamper (with)

prison sentence → to be behind bars
a punitive law → a stricter punishment

public anger → a furore
a crime → an offence (or "offense" in the US)

This figure of speech from the article means to start an activity 
(like a protest) to achieve a result.
to wage a campaign
We are waging a campaign against the company for better pay.

food tampering , contaminated punnets, spiked fruit

The offence would normally carry a three-year sentence.
This is the British spelling of "offence" as seen in the article. 
In American English, you would see it spelled as "offense".

a ten-year prison sentence - a decade behind bars
a more punitive law - a stricter punishment
a criminal offence - an illegal act

he Crown is a figure of speech! 👑
"Fifty year old My Ut Trinh was a supervisor at one of the affected farms 
and waged a pointed campaign 'motivated by spite or revenge', the Crown alleges."

The Crown is a term we use to refer to the functions of government, 
specifically in constitutional monarchies like the UK or Commonwealth 
countries like Australia that are theoretically still ruled by a queen or 
king. So when we read "the Crown" we understand it to mean the state.

"The offence was 'motivated by spite or revenge', the Crown alleges." - 
What does "the Crown" refer to?
the government or state

"The offence would normally carry a three year sentence... 
Ms Trinh could spend a decade behind bars."
"A decade" means 10 years. "Behind bars" refers to being in prison.

"public anger"
The furore prompted the passage of a more punitive law.

revenge - hurt someone in return for something they did
spite - hurt someone out of anger and resentment
allege - accuse someone of illegal activities

Do we need a more punitive law against cyberbullying, such as a prison sentence?
"Punitive" means strict. A "punnet" is a container (such as a box).

a suitable synonym for "contaminate"
Waiters were warned not to tamper with the dishes when serving them.
"Tamper with" means to contaminate. 
"Allege" means to accuse someone of doing something wrong.

VOCABULARY

a hoax

to pull (stock) from the shelves

to wage a campaign

Features of a news article

We've looked at the key features of 
a news article (and their English names).

In the next part of this lesson, 
we are going to take a closer look 
at the style of writing reports and the types of sentences we use.

Here's a reminder of the features and what they mean! 🗒

a headline (n) – 
the large title of a news article usually 
not written in complete sentences

a subtitle (n) – the first sentence of a news 
article that tells the main story

a paragraph (n) – a group of sentences that relate to a topic

a quotation (n) – a statement of what a person 
said (using "quotation marks" to show this)

report writing - news articles, business journals
creative writing - poems, novels, movie scripts

It is claimed the robber stole $2 million worth of diamonds.
You'd expect to read this sentence in a news article.

I was sitting silently in our cold, dimly-lit living room, 
staring intently at my cup of boiling hot, freshly-brewed coffee.
This sentence is very descriptive and personal, like a creative text.

"I could feel the warm glow from the sun on my tired, weathered face."
This is an example of creative writing that is personal and 
uses descriptiveadjectives.

"Dr Beluchi was said to have lost 40% of his patients during his residency."
This reporting sentence is objective and uses statistics.

The passive with "it" for reporting verbs
If you want to use a reporting verb (said, claimed, reported) in the 
passive voice, we can start with the word "it" and use this structure:

It + to be + reporting verb (past participle) + that + sentence
Have a look at the examples below.
It is said that a lack of protein can lead to hair loss.
It was claimed that the divorce settlement exceeded $10 million.
It has been reported that 80% of students miss online learning.

Charges dropped in strawberry needle case
It has been reported that the food contamination case against 
My Ut Trinh was dropped after three years.

The 53-year-old was informed that the trial would no longer go ahead. 
At the time, it was alleged that she had inserted needles 
into strawberries grown in the farm she supervised.

“The prosecution have indicated they would no longer go ahead with the 
charges against you.”, the Crown informed Ms Trinh. It is said that Ms 
Trinh was pleased with the outcome as her lawyer stated, “She thanks 
everyone who believed in her innocence.”

In September 2018, 230 police reports were filed of needle contamination, 
prompting supermarkets to pull their supply of strawberries from their shelves.

Her lawyer stated, “She thanks everyone who believed in her innocence.”
This is a quotation from the lawyer's statement.

It has been reported that the food contamination case against 
My Ut Trinh was dropped after three years.
"It has been reported" is in the passive voice. It does not tell us 
who reported the information.

It is estimated that fruit farmers had lost around $160 million.
"It is estimated" is in the passive voice. It does not tell us 
who provided this information.

Why do we use the passive voice in report writing?
It's used to make our writing more formal and to avoid mentioning the speaker.

She was informed that the trial would not proceed.

Have a look at the text. Which reporting verbs were used?
alleged, informed

It was claimed that the divorce settlement exceeded $10 million.
It has been reported that students prefer online learning.
It has been confirmed that Ms Trinh will no longer be charged.
It has been said that demand for direct flights has increased.
It was said that James had been fired.

An interview with Macau's Minister of Tourism 🇲🇴 on the impact of the film "Suite Con"

Reporter:
Mr Tang, you’ve heard of hit comedy "Suite Con", a hoax comedy 
where a fake couple trick casinos across Macau into giving them free hotel rooms. 
Would you say your city’s become famous?

Mr Tang:
Oh yes! We’re very excited that our city's gone mainstream. 
The success of Suite Con has led to a tourism boost.

Reporter:
What has been the impact on tourism?

Mr Tang:
All rooms in three of our top hotels are fully booked for the next 24 months. 
Also, some airlines are opening direct flights to Macau for the very first time.

Reporter:
Where will people be able to fly from?

Mr Tang:
Hopefully, the new flights from New York, Dubai and Paris will go ahead as planned. 
Right now, you can only fly direct from 8 countries, so it’s crazy 
what one film can do for a city!

Reporter:
Macau is also known as "The Vegas of the East", but are tourists 
just interested in the casinos?

Mr Tang:
Oh, no, Macau is more than that! Not only did they show all the gentrified areas 
like the Macau Tower, but some scenes take place at Portuguese colonial landmarks 
like the Ruins of St Paul's Church where Jennifer tries a pastel de nata.

Reporter:
Finally, do you think this film will attract copycat criminals 
trying to get free rooms in your hotels?

Mr Tang:
Hahaha! That would be frightening!

Which sentence best summarises the interview with Mr Tang?
Tourism boosts in Macau thanks to comedy hit Suite Con.

Which quote from Mr Tang describes how the film benefitted Macau's tourism?
"All rooms in our top hotels are fully booked."
Tourism has increased as more people are booking hotel rooms in the city.

Film shows both the modern and historic sights of Macau.

"Don't quote me on that!", she said.
When we want to state exactly what someone's said, 
must use quotation marks, like this → " "

We can include a reporting phrase (a person's name + a reporting verb) 
either before or after the sentence.

Have a look at the examples below to see how we write quotations. 
Notice the comma that separates the reporting phrase from the sentence?

Mr Tang responded, "That would be frightening."

"The cameras show Arthur had been asleep while driving", police reported.

"Mr Tang, stated" all rooms in our top hotels are fully booked.
Mr Tang, stated, "All rooms in our top hotels are fully booked."

Currently, there are only 8|eight countries with direct flights to Macau.

Here's a reminder! 💡
To write a reporting statement using the passive voice with "it", 
we use this structure:

6. Listening to descriptions of heroes - Learn about heroes in "Star Wars"

Some new words 🔍
The video has some "movie-specific" vocabulary (words that are common when 
discussing the world of film). Here are some definitions before we watch:

an editor (n): someone who decides the final content of a movie, book or magazine
montage (n): the technique of creating a scene from pictures, text, or music
a pan (n): a movement of the camera across a horizontal or vertical scene
a layout (n): the way a scene is arranged
ILM (n): Industrial Light & Magic, Lucasfilm’s special effects and animation studio
relatable (adj): you feel an emotional connection with a "relatable" character

The director focuses on the way they filmed this battle scene.

The director focuses on the way they filmed this battle scene.
"Everything is wobbling" (moving unsteadily) is the present continuous.

Do you remember?
We describe scenes and events from films in the present, 
as if what we are describing is happening right now. 
We do this to make the story seem more engaging or dramatic. 🚀

In the video the director is commenting on the scene that we are watching with him. 
Perhaps you noticed that he said things like "you see" and 
"our heroes" to include us in the action.

You can just see everything is wobbling on these things.
They’re...going up against these massive tanks.
...you see she’s scared.
You see once again our heroes don’t have a chance.

They’re going up against these massive tanks.
You can just see everything is wobbling on these things.

You see once again our heroes don’t have a chance.

"So, this is the battle of Crate..."
Unlike the more formal film reviews you wrote in a recent lesson, 
the director's oral description of the battle scene contains many features of informal, 
spoken English, which often don't add meaning to the sentence. 💬

We heard the examples below in the video:

so
Often used to signal the start of a story or explanation.
"So, this is the battle of Crate..."

just
Used for emphasis, with a similar meaning to "simply".
"It just feels like our brave heroes going into battle."

you know
Sometimes used like "um" when thinking about what to say next.
"Because, you know, in a PG 13 Star Wars movie you can’t..."

basically
Used just before an explanation, even if it's not basic!
"They’re in, basically, rolling lawnmowers."

"So, this is all about geography, this big pan here..."
"So" signals the start of a story or explanation.

So last Friday I went so see the new Star Wars movie, 
and I was pleasantly surprised – I really enjoyed it!

Just 👌
The word "just" has various meanings, and in the video the director uses 
it frequently as an adverb (it comes before a verb).

It doesn't change the significance of what he is saying, 
but it has a similar meaning to "simply".

You just want to feel that this is David versus Goliath.
You can just see everything is wobbling on these things.
It just feels like our brave heroes going into battle.

I just love going to the cinema, it's the best way to experience an action film!

Because, you know, in a PG 13 Star Wars movie you can’t really show the violence of a battle.

"They’re in, basically, rolling lawnmowers."
We use "basically" to indicate that we are summarising the most important aspects of something.

Basically, I've been locked out of my house and I need some help.

Here's a tip!
On the next screen we will hear all these expressions in another informal conversation. 👂

The director focuses on the way they filmed this battle scene.

You're a hero! 🦸
You've already learned a lot of new language this lesson.🏅 
To finish the lesson we are going to give our thoughts on heroes.

1) "...even having the open canopies so our heroes feel very exposed, 
and you just want to feel that this is David versus Goliath even them falling apart..."
2) "...when the fighters come and you see once again our heroes 
don’t have a chance, it’s like hawks versus mice."

"...when the fighters come and you see once again our heroes 
don’t have a chance, it’s like hawks versus mice."
A "metaphor" is an image that is representative of something else. 
The "hawks versus mice" represent the fighters against our heroes.

Hawks versus mice 🦅 🐭
The director uses the metaphors of "David and Goliath" and "hawks and mice" 
to emphasise the big challenge the Star Wars heroes are facing in the battle. 
David and Goliath is a story from the Bible about a fight between a man and a giant, 
and, like the image of mice fighting hawks, it represents an uneven fight.

In films and stories, heroes are often represented as the underdog 
(someone who is unlikely to win a fight or competition). This means that 
they feel more relatable to us, and that their success is more impressive.

"And I love this moment with Kelly, it’s so relatable, just it’s a big 
heroic moment, but you see she’s scared, and you see that she takes some 
strength and goes into battle."

If a character is "relatable", we can form an emotional connection to them.

Basically, my favourite heroes in movies or books are those that I can, 
you know, identify with. They have to have human issues, otherwise I can't connect with them.

When you think of a hero, it's usually just the image of a strong warrior 
in battle that comes to mind. But actually, the most heroic characters are 
emotionally vulnerable in some way.

It's your turn!
On the next screen, you'll be asked to share your opinion about heroes 
with the Busuu Community. You can do it! ⭐

Do we need a more punitive law against cyberbullying, such as a prison sentence?
"Punitive" means strict. A "punnet" is a container (such as a box).
