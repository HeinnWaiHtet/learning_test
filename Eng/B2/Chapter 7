"I've broken up with my girlfriend." 
→ He said he had broken up with his girlfriend.

→ He said he had only been talking to him.

We move the verb back one tense. (e.g. "I am" → "I was")

Reported speech

When we want to report somebody's original words we:
👉🏽 change future and present forms to past forms. 🔙
👉🏽 change past forms to past perfect. 🔙 

Direct speech 
"I will never star in a rom-com."
"I'm on the cover of the magazine." 
"We're shooting a film." 
"I've broken up with my girlfriend."
"I was only talking to him, we're not a couple." 
"The director personally chose the cast." 

Indirect speech

🛎️ Watch out for exceptions! 🛎️
In some situations, we don't need to change the verb form when we use indirect speech.

For example: 
👉 when we report something immediately after it happens and it's still true

What did she just say? She said she's going home.  
👉 when we report a general truth 

The teacher said that wolves live in packs. 
👉 after verbs and verbal phrases that don't have past forms such as "might", 
"would", "should", "had better", "used to", "could", "mustn't"

The actor said he might audition for the role. 

"The actress said Antarctica is covered with ice."
It's a general truth. 

"The director said he feels disappointed with the Academy's decision."
Why is there no verb change in this indirect sentence?
It's reported immediately after he says it and it's still true.

Choose the verbs that don't change in indirect speech.
You should go to the doctor.
I might stop acting for a while.
should go, might

Must and mustn't
While "mustn't" doesn't change its form "must" can change to "had to" 
when we talk about obligation.

must 
She said, "I must believe in myself more." → She said she had to/must believe in herself more. 

mustn't 
She said, " I mustn't worry about my career." → She said she mustn't worry about her career. 

1. "They said they must try harder." 2. "They said they had to try harder."
Both sentences are correct.

Pam said she was trying to focus on the positive and that 
she shouldn't be bothered by nasty comments.

She said she had wanted to keep the divorce private but then she had decided to speak out.

She also said we had better|'d better bring visibility to the issue.
We use "had better" as strong advice if we believe there will be 
negative consequences for not doing something.

She said she was going to take some time off and she would continue working on her beauty products.
She also said we might not hear much from her.

Thorny case: fruit sabotage in Australia
This is the title of an article about a particular fruit 
that was contaminated (made unhealthy to eat) in Australia in 2018.

Which fruit do you think was contaminated ? 🍌🍇🍏🍒
Let's read the first sentence of the article to see if your guess was correct.

Thorny case: fruit sabotage in Australia

The Economist
Fruit growers lost millions of dollars when needles inexplicably started 
appearing inside strawberries this September.

This article is about strawberries being contaminated in Australian farms.

"Fruit growers lost millions of dollars when needles inexplicably 
started appearing inside strawberries."
Farmers lost a lot of money as a result of the contamination.
Nobody could explain (it was "inexplicable") how the needles got inside the strawberries.

The title of this article is a pun (a play on words with a double meaning). 😮
A thorny case describes a problem or difficult situation, 
much like the one in this story!

However, this phrase also has a literal meaning based on the context of this article: 
"thorny" relates to sharpness (in this case the needles)🪡 and 
"case" can mean a container 🧺, like the punnets (boxes) of strawberries. 🍓

So, the news title refers to both "a difficult situation" and 
"a box of sharp objects".

Here are some more words that appear in the article. ⤵️
thorny (adj) – causing a problem or difficulty / sharp
to contaminate / to spike something (v) – to make something unsafe to eat
to sabotage (v) – to destroy or damage something
a needle (n) –  a pointy object with a sharp end
inexplicably (adv) – without a reason or explanation
a hoax (n) – a lie, a trick or a fake claim
a copycat (n) – a person who imitates someone's behaviour or image

Thorny case: fruit sabotage in Australia
The Economist
Fruit growers lost millions of dollars when needles inexplicably 
started appearing inside strawberries this September. 
The first case was recorded in Queensland, when an unfortunate shopper 
found a surprise inside his snack. Within days, copycats had contaminated 
punnets across the country, prompting supermarkets to pull strawberries 
(and sewing needles) from their shelves. Police received a total of 186 
reports of spiked fruit, although a few turned out to be hoaxes.

Today the first person to be charged for those crimes appeared at a court 
in Brisbane. Fifty year old My Ut Trinh was a supervisor at one of the 
affected farms and waged a pointed campaign “motivated by spite or 
revenge”, the Crown alleges. The offence would normally carry a three-year 
sentence, but the furore prompted the passage of a more punitive law on 
food tampering. If she is found guilty, Ms Trinh could spend a decade 
behind bars.

Shoppers found sewing needles inside the strawberries they had bought.

In Queensland, an unfortunate customer discovered the strawberries 
he bought contained needles.
The word "unfortunate" refers to having bad luck. 
"Inexplicable" refers to something that cannot be explained.

"Within days, copycats had contaminated punnets across the country."
A "copycat" imitates someone's behaviour or image.

"made something unsafe to eat". - contaminated

a hoax - a trick or a fake claim is to say it's...
He pretended his horse was a unicorn. The whole story was a hoax!

"Police received a total of 186 reports of spiked fruit, although 
a few turned out to be hoaxes."
* Only "a few" turned out to be fake.

"to stop selling a product and remove them from the store" is...
to pull (stock) from the shelves
Supermarkets pulled strawberries and needles from the shelves.

They removed all strawberries and sewing needles from their stores.

"boxes" or "containers" for fruit.
Ms Trinh was charged with contaminating punnets of strawberries.

A farm supervisor was charged for starting a crime wave of 
inserting needles into strawberries.

Let's go deeper into the text! 👓
Newspaper editors use figures of speech (words that mean something 
different from their literal definition) that give the reader a stronger 
description, such as:

👉 a thorny case – a difficult situation
👉 to pull stock from the shelves – to stop selling something
👉 to wage a campaign – to start. an activity or protest

They also use synonyms (words with the same or similar meaning) to avoid 
repetition, like these below. ⤵️

farmers → fruit growers
to contaminate → to spike → to tamper (with)

prison sentence → to be behind bars
a punitive law → a stricter punishment

public anger → a furore
a crime → an offence (or "offense" in the US)

This figure of speech from the article means to start an activity 
(like a protest) to achieve a result.
to wage a campaign
We are waging a campaign against the company for better pay.

food tampering , contaminated punnets, spiked fruit

The offence would normally carry a three-year sentence.
This is the British spelling of "offence" as seen in the article. 
In American English, you would see it spelled as "offense".

a ten-year prison sentence - a decade behind bars
a more punitive law - a stricter punishment
a criminal offence - an illegal act

he Crown is a figure of speech! 👑
"Fifty year old My Ut Trinh was a supervisor at one of the affected farms 
and waged a pointed campaign 'motivated by spite or revenge', the Crown alleges."

The Crown is a term we use to refer to the functions of government, 
specifically in constitutional monarchies like the UK or Commonwealth 
countries like Australia that are theoretically still ruled by a queen or 
king. So when we read "the Crown" we understand it to mean the state.

"The offence was 'motivated by spite or revenge', the Crown alleges." - 
What does "the Crown" refer to?
the government or state

"The offence would normally carry a three year sentence... 
Ms Trinh could spend a decade behind bars."
"A decade" means 10 years. "Behind bars" refers to being in prison.

"public anger"
The furore prompted the passage of a more punitive law.

revenge - hurt someone in return for something they did
spite - hurt someone out of anger and resentment
allege - accuse someone of illegal activities

Do we need a more punitive law against cyberbullying, such as a prison sentence?
"Punitive" means strict. A "punnet" is a container (such as a box).

a suitable synonym for "contaminate"
Waiters were warned not to tamper with the dishes when serving them.
"Tamper with" means to contaminate. 
"Allege" means to accuse someone of doing something wrong.
