🛎️ Watch out for exceptions! 🛎️
In some situations, we don't need to change the verb form when we use indirect speech.

For example: 
👉 when we report something immediately after it happens and it's still true

What did she just say? She said she's going home.  
👉 when we report a general truth 

The teacher said that wolves live in packs. 
👉 after verbs and verbal phrases that don't have past forms such as "might", 
"would", "should", "had better", "used to", "could", "mustn't"

The actor said he might audition for the role. 

"The actress said Antarctica is covered with ice."
It's a general truth. 

"The director said he feels disappointed with the Academy's decision."
Why is there no verb change in this indirect sentence?
It's reported immediately after he says it and it's still true.

Choose the verbs that don't change in indirect speech.
You should go to the doctor.
I might stop acting for a while.
should go, might

Must and mustn't
While "mustn't" doesn't change its form "must" can change to "had to" 
when we talk about obligation.

must 
She said, "I must believe in myself more." → She said she had to/must believe in herself more. 

mustn't 
She said, " I mustn't worry about my career." → She said she mustn't worry about her career. 

1. "They said they must try harder." 2. "They said they had to try harder."
Both sentences are correct.

she shouldn't be bothered by nasty comments.

She also said we had better|'d better bring visibility to the issue.
We use "had better" as strong advice if we believe there will be 
negative consequences for not doing something.
