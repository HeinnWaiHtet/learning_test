2. Interpreting statistics - Read an annual report - including material from The Economist

Welcome back! 👋
In this lesson, we'll learn how to talk about statistics and will read 
an article from the Economist.

The statistics show you'll complete the lesson in under 10 minutes. Ready? 😊

the figures show (that)...

Which words have a similar meaning to "statistics"?
stats, numbers, figures, data

Let's read!
You're about to read an article from The Economist newspaper about an OECD's 
(The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) annual report. 
Before you start, have a look at the words from the article and predict 
what the report is about. 

👉 a check-up
👉 life expectancy
👉 a circulatory disease
👉 mortality rates

The report includes vocabulary like "check-up", "life expectancy", 
"circulatory disease", "mortality rates". 
What do you think the report is about?
health

Today comes the OECD’s annual health check-up, covering the problems of 36 
mostly rich countries with an average life expectancy over 80 years. 
Mental health problems are growing; they will affect one in two people 
at some point in their lives. Circulatory disease now accounts for one 
in three deaths and cancer one in four across the developed world.
But in a bright spot, mortality rates have dropped rapidly 
in the European Union, by 40% for heart disease and 50% for strokes since 2000. 
But this takes money. Health-care spending, 10% of GDP on average, 
continues rising. And inequality, particularly in education, corresponds 
with a gulf in outcomes: a 30-year-old European man with only secondary-school
education is eight percentage points more likely to be obese than 
his university-educated peer, and can expect to live seven years less. 
While correlation is not causation, it seems people learn and live rather than 
live and learn.

According to the statistics, what influences someone's state of health?
education

Which negative health aspect do the statistics show?
Mental health problems are on the rise.

What hopeful figures are mentioned in the article?
Fewer and fewer people die of heart disease.

The figures suggest that fewer people have died of heart diseases and strokes 
because of the money governments put towards healthcare.

Statistically speaking, 30-year-old men spend more money on their health than 
before but still live seven years less than women.

Why does the author conclude the article with 
"it seems people learn and live rather than live and learn"?
to stress the connection between mortality rates and education

According to the statistics, we are seeing an increase in mental health problems.

Mortality rates have dropped rapidly in the European Union.

By a third
When we want to say how much something has changed statistically, 
we use the preposition "by". 

Food prices have gone up by a third this year. 
For heart disease, mortality rates have dropped by 40%.

Health-care spending, 10% of GDP on average, continues rising.

Circulatory disease now accounts for one in three deaths, and cancer one 
in four, across the developed world.

A 30-year-old European man with secondary-school education is more likely 
to be obese than his university-educated peer.

Recap
You're likely to see the expressions below when reading a text based on statistics.
Who knows, you might even need to use them yourself one day. 😉

👉 the statistics/figures/numbers/data/stats show that...
👉 according to the statistics...
👉 statistically speaking,...
👉 on average
👉 mortality/unemployment rate
👉 be x % more likely to
👉 to account for
👉 to see a rise/growth/drop/decline in
