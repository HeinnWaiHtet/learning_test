2. Interpreting statistics - Read an annual report - including material from The Economist

Welcome back! 👋
In this lesson, we'll learn how to talk about statistics and will read 
an article from the Economist.

The statistics show you'll complete the lesson in under 10 minutes. Ready? 😊

the figures show (that)...
The figures show that one-third of adults still sleep with a comfort object.

on average
On average, an American generates nearly 4.5 pounds of trash each day.

In this sentence "figures" means "numbers".

In Japan, there is on average one vending machine for every 23 people.

to be likely to...
The statistics show that you're more likely to become an astronaut than win the lottery.

according to the statistics...

Stats
If you find yourself discussing numbers in an informal setting, 
you can say "stats" instead of "statistics".
We've just received the performance stats for this quarter.
We have to look at the stats before we make a decision.

rates
Birth rates are dropping globally.

to see a rise in...
The e-scooter market has seen a rise in demand.

2021 saw a rise in company creation.
Currently, the unemployment rate in the European Union is at 6.2%.

Here's a tip!
You can replace the word "rise" in "to see a rise in something" 
with any other word describing a trend.

to see a drop in something ⬇️
to see a decrease in something ⬇️

to see an increase in something ⬆️
to see a growth in something ⬆️

Shops are seeing a growth in gluten-free products.
People buy more gluten-free products now than in the past.

Which words have a similar meaning to "statistics"?
stats, numbers, figures, data

Let's read!
You're about to read an article from The Economist newspaper about an OECD's 
(The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) annual report. 
Before you start, have a look at the words from the article and predict 
what the report is about. 

👉 a check-up
👉 life expectancy
👉 a circulatory disease
👉 mortality rates

The report includes vocabulary like "check-up", "life expectancy", 
"circulatory disease", "mortality rates". 
What do you think the report is about?
health

Today comes the OECD’s annual health check-up, covering the problems of 36 
mostly rich countries with an average life expectancy over 80 years. 
Mental health problems are growing; they will affect one in two people 
at some point in their lives. Circulatory disease now accounts for one 
in three deaths and cancer one in four across the developed world.
But in a bright spot, mortality rates have dropped rapidly 
in the European Union, by 40% for heart disease and 50% for strokes since 2000. 
But this takes money. Health-care spending, 10% of GDP on average, 
continues rising. And inequality, particularly in education, corresponds 
with a gulf in outcomes: a 30-year-old European man with only secondary-school
education is eight percentage points more likely to be obese than 
his university-educated peer, and can expect to live seven years less. 
While correlation is not causation, it seems people learn and live rather than 
live and learn.

According to the statistics, what influences someone's state of health?
education

Which negative health aspect do the statistics show?
Mental health problems are on the rise.

What hopeful figures are mentioned in the article?
Fewer and fewer people die of heart disease.

The figures suggest that fewer people have died of heart diseases and strokes 
because of the money governments put towards healthcare.

Statistically speaking, 30-year-old men spend more money on their health than 
before but still live seven years less than women.

Why does the author conclude the article with 
"it seems people learn and live rather than live and learn"?
to stress the connection between mortality rates and education

According to the statistics, we are seeing an increase in mental health problems.

Mortality rates have dropped rapidly in the European Union.

By a third
When we want to say how much something has changed statistically, 
we use the preposition "by". 

Food prices have gone up by a third this year. 
For heart disease, mortality rates have dropped by 40%.

Health-care spending, 10% of GDP on average, continues rising.

Circulatory disease now accounts for one in three deaths, and cancer one 
in four, across the developed world.

A 30-year-old European man with secondary-school education is more likely 
to be obese than his university-educated peer.

Recap
You're likely to see the expressions below when reading a text based on statistics.
Who knows, you might even need to use them yourself one day. 😉

👉 the statistics/figures/numbers/data/stats show that...
👉 according to the statistics...
👉 statistically speaking,...
👉 on average
👉 mortality/unemployment rate
👉 be x % more likely to
👉 to account for
👉 to see a rise/growth/drop/decline in

3. The Causative - Form and use the causative

The Causative

In this lesson, we'll follow Raul who is travelling around Türkiye by car. 🚘 🗺️
It's a great plan...until it isn't! Raul finds himself using the causative 
("Can I have my teeth checked?") to ask other people to do something for him.

Who is Raul calling?
breakdown services

Why was Raul relieved?
He could communicate easily.
Raul's car wasn't serviced recently and can't be repaired roadside.

"Raul had his car serviced a year ago." What does this sentence mean?
A mechanic checked that everything is fine with the car.

 the action happened in the past.
 what happened to the car.
 Raul had his car serviced a year ago
 had 
serviced

Raul had his car serviced a year ago.
The important information is what happened not who did it.

Have something done
"Have something done" is used when someone does something for us because 
we instruct them to, especially when we pay for a service. 💰

The hairdresser cut my hair. → "I had my hair cut."

"Have" is the verb that changes its form.
"I'm having my door painted next week." 

The verb that describes the action is always in the past participle ("-ed" or irregular form).
"I have my teeth checked once a year."

The object (e.g. my hair) comes between "have" and the "-ed" form. 
"I had my hair cut."

She had her carpet cleaned yesterday.
I have had my nails done this morning.
I had my phone fixed at a low cost.

Get something done
You can use "get" instead of "have" in these sentences and the meaning is the same. 

"I had my car serviced."
"I got my car serviced."

"He's having his hair cut."
"He's getting his hair cut."

Linda got her living room redecorated.
She asked somebody, probably an interior designer, to do it for her.

What is Raul worried about?
Raul is worried that his...insurance won't pay for the repairs.

He had a spark plug correctly installed.
Getting his brakes repaired cost Raul a lot of money.
He has got two tyres replaced.
Raul has had the oil changed.

-------------------------
4. More about the causative - Talk about someone doing something for you

Here's a tip!
In the previous lesson, we looked at the causative form "have/get something done".
 
"I got my hair cut."
The action, not the person who does the action, is important

You feel you can't see very well and want to get medical advice. What do you say?
I need to get my eyes tested.

Here's a tip!
In this lesson, we'll learn two new causative structures used to mention 
who does the action – "have somebody do something" and "get somebody to do something"

But first, we're going to listen to a conversation between two friends Clara and Joel. 
Here is some vocabulary that will help you understand them a little better.
Vocabulary
a bad hair day (n) –  a day when you don't feel attractive and everything goes wrong 
yikes (exclamation) – an informal way to show that you're surprised, worried or shocked
freaking (adj) – an informal way to intensify what is being said 

Clara: Jesus, man! What happened to you? Having a bad hair day?
Joel: Ha, ha, ha very funny. ... I've cut my own hair. I watched this 
tutorial on YouTube and it looked very easy, but it wasn't. Here's the result.
Clara: First, yikes - you'll need to wear a hat for a long time and second 
your mom is a freaking hairdresser, why didn't you have your mom cut your hair? 

Why can't Clara stop laughing?
Joel's hair looks ridiculous.

"Why didn't you have your mom cut your hair?"
Carla thinks that Joel should have asked his mom to cut his hair.

"Have somebody do something"
If you want to mention who does an action for you because you instruct them 
or ask them to, use "have somebody do something". 

"Have" is the verb that changes its form.
"I had the waiter bring the menu."

The verb describing the action is in its basic form.
"She had the children clean their room."

I cut my hair. - I did the action.
I had my hair cut. - I paid somebody to do the action.
I had my mom cut my hair. - My mom did the action.

I had my hair cut. - focus on the action
I had my mom cut my hair. - focus on the person who does the action

I had the taxi driver drive faster.
I'll have my colleague read the report.

"Get somebody to do something"
You can use "get somebody to do something" instead of "have somebody do something".

🛎️ Watch out for the "to" that goes with "get somebody to do something". 🛎️
I had my mum cut my hair.
I got my mum to cut my hair. 
I got my friend to look after my children.

You're calling your dentist because your teeth hurt. What do you say?
I'd like to get the dentist to check my teeth.

You've bought groceries online and are now waiting for the delivery. 
What do you say?
I'm having the supermarket deliver the shopping.

a similar meaning to I had the mechanic fix the brakes.
I got the mechanic to fix the brakes.

You want your assistant to help you send some emails. What do you say?
I'll have my assistant send|get my assistant to send these emails.

Your windows need cleaning and you want your boyfriend to do it. 
What do you say?

I'm going to get my boyfriend to clean|have my boyfriend clean the windows.
have my boyfriend clean

Final recap
Now you know how to use the causative to talk about things other people do for you! 👏

Here are all the forms:

have/get something done
the focus is on the action
"I had my nails done."

have somebody do something
get somebody to do something 
the focus is on the person
"I got my sister to do my nails."

------------------------------------
5. Unreal/mixed conditionals - Form and use mixed conditionals

If I were you, I would tell her the truth.
I'm talking about an unreal present or hypothetical situation and a consequence.
The 2nd conditional imagines a hypothetical situation (if I were you) 
and a present consequence.

If I had more time, I would go to the gym.

If I were Richard, I would have applied for that job ages ago.
This conditional mixes a hypothetical situation (if I were Richard) 
and a past consequence (I would have applied).

A mixed (hypothetical) conditional
************************************
We use "if" and the past simple ("were") to introduce 
a hypothetical situation, but you can either use:

1. "would/could/might" and the infinitive ("be") to refer to a present consequence
or
2. "would/could/might" and the present perfect ("have been") to refer to 
a past consequence (which is one type of mixed conditional).

a present consequence (2nd conditional)
"If he weren't already married, I would be his wife now."

a past consequence (mixed conditional)
"If he weren't already married, I would have married him."

"If he weren't already married..."
I would have married him myself. - a different past consequence
I would be his wife now. - a different present consequence

If he weren't your friend, I would have fired him ages ago.
Kamo wouldn't have got the modelling gig if he weren't so handsome.
If he weren't already married, I would have married him.

You're a star! 🌟
You've just learned one way to create a mixed conditional sentence! 😃
Next we'll look at how to mix up the 3rd (past) conditional! 🥄

Did you know? 💡
You can change the order of the two parts of the sentence and 
write the consequence before the situation. Look at these examples. 👇

I would have married him myself, if he weren't already married.
I'd (I would) be rich if I had a dollar for every time I heard that.

I would've recovered faster if I had taken the pills.
The past conditional imagines a past situation (if I had taken pills) 
and a past consequence (I would have recovered).

We would have finished the report yesterday if we had started writing last week.

If I had saved around 10% of my income, I could buy a house now.
I'm talking about a past situation and a present consequence.
This is a mixed conditional with a past situation (if I had saved 10%) and 
a present consequence (I could buy a house).

Another mixed conditional!
The rules are generally similar to the first type of mixed conditional, 
but do note the differences in verb tenses!

We use "if" and the past perfect ("had been") to introduce a past situation, 
but you can either use:

1. "would/could/might" and the present perfect ("have been") to refer to a past consequence
or
2. "would/could/might" and the infinitive ("be") to refer to a 
present consequence (which is another type of mixed conditional).

a past consequence (3rd conditional)
If we had left earlier, we would have been on time.

a present consequence (mixed conditional)
If we had left earlier, we would be at the party now.

"If we had left the house earlier..."
...we would have been on time. - a different past consequence
...we would be at the party now. - a different present consequence

If Vince had listened to the doctor, he wouldn't need surgery.
The singer would be in jail if the press had reported his tax evasion.

"I would have passed the maths test if the exam board rules allowed the use of calculators."
The exam board usually doesn't allow calculators so I failed the test.

If I hadn't learned Spanish, I wouldn't be qualified for the job in Madrid."

"I wouldn't have burned the eggs..."if I knew how to cook.
"If I weren't so busy these days..."I would have travelled abroad.

We asked members of the public... 🎤
You're going to listen to a vox pop (or "voice of the people", 
a quick interview with random people on the street) where each person answers 
the question below.

Think about (or write down) your answer to this question. 
We'd love to hear from you in the next Busuu Community post! 🥰

Think of one skill you have.
What wouldn't you have achieved without it?

Think of one skill you have. What wouldn't you have achieved without it?
****************************************
Person 1: Definitely organisation. We just bought a new house and 
I'd never have been able to finish unpacking over the weekend 
if I weren't so organised.     

Person 2: Thank goodness I learned French at uni. 
That's the only reason why I applied for the job in Paris.

Person 3: Skills? [laughs] I'll tell you the opposite. 
If I weren't so clumsy, I wouldn't have broken my grandma's favourite vase 
when playing football in the house.

Person 4: I don't like to give up. If I weren't so stubborn, 
I wouldn't have passed my driving test after failing 5 times.

Person 5: You know, My fear of injections really stopped me from studying medicine, 
so I never ended up being a doctor.

"I'd never have been able to finish unpacking over the weekend if I weren't so organised."
Person 1 finished unpacking because she's organised.

If I didn't speak French, my job application would have been rejected.
If I weren't so clumsy, I wouldn't have broken my grandma's favourite vase.
If I weren't so stubborn, I wouldn't have passed my driving test after failing 5 times.
I probably would've become a doctor if I weren't so afraid of needles!

------------------------------
6. Developing fluency - Practise with English native speakers

If it weren't so expensive we would've had dinner there.
"I'd join you on the trip if I hadn't spent all my money."
I would have said nothing if I were you.
If we had left earlier, we would be home now.
If I hadn't made that tough decision...

What else did the public say? 🎤💬
Let's continue practising mixed conditionals and listen to the same people 
from last lesson's vox pop answer the question below.

Think about your own answers as you'll to get a chance to share them 
with the Busuu Community! ✍🏼 🎙

What piece of advice changed your life?
How would your life be different if you hadn't received it?

What piece of advice changed in your life? 
How would your life be different if you hadn't received it?

Person 1: My father-in-law advised, 
"Ignoring your problems is worse than fighting about them." 
James and I would probably be divorced if we had avoided all conflicts.

Person 2: Dad always has this brilliant line that goes, 
"Dreams are dreams until you take action." 
I am moving to Dubai next month to start my dream job!

Person 3: I was terrified of asking a classmate for her number
 until I remembered, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." 
 If I had been too scared to talk to her, I wouldn't be marrying her this year.

Person 4: As I said earlier, I'm very stubborn. 
I watched a sports film where the coach said, 
"Quitters never win, and winners never quit." 
You can see where I'm going with this, can't you? Would I be driving 
this car today without this driver's licence?

Person 5: I live by this tip, 
"If you have something to give away, don't bother lending it." 
I wonder, would I have no more friends left if I'd expected my friends 
to return what they'd borrowed from me

James and I would probably be divorced if we had avoided all conflicts.

If I had not listened to my dad's advice, I wouldn't be going to Dubai.
If I had been too scared to talk to her, I wouldn't be marrying her this year.
Would I be driving a car today if I had stopped taking my driving tests?

Would I have no more friends left if I'd expected my friends to return 
what they'd borrowed from me?

I'd have a better career...If I had studied harder.

"If you didn't have a particular skill or habit..."what wouldn't you have achieved?

If you hadn't received that piece of advice..."where would you be now?

Answer at least one question: 
1. What wouldn't you've achieved if you didn't have a particular skill or habit? 
2. Where would you be now if you hadn't ever received a particular piece of advice?
