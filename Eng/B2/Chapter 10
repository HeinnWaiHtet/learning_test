Communication
1. Intercultural communication - Learn to interact with people from other cultures

The residents of Quay Point are meeting each other for the first time.

Arshad:
Hi, I am Arshad, but call me Ash! Have you been here long?

Kiko:
Hello, my name is Kiko. Lovely to meet you. 
And yes, I moved in yesterday from Tokyo. Welcome!

Arshad:
Thank you. My wife and I just moved to the city to study a Master's in 
Human Resources Management. We used to work together back in Jordan, 
but, you know, the money's not great unless you have a degree from 
abroad... so, here we are! What about you? What do you do here?

Kiko:
I work in Human Resources, so we have something in common! 
Are you enjoying it here so far?

Rick:
Hey guys! Sorry to interrupt you. I just thought I'd introduce myself. 
I'm Rick!

Arshad:
I guess you're new here, too! I'm Ash, nice to meet you. This is Kiko. 
We just found out we're both in HR!

Kiko:
Yeah! What a coincidence!

Rick:
The pleasure's all mine, Ash, Kiko.

Kiko:
What do you do for a living, Rick?

Rick:
Well, I'm not in HR like you guys! Haha. 
I'm actually a Bid Manager at a construction firm down in Deansgate.

Kiko:
Sounds interesting. What does that involve?

Rick:
You know, I ask myself that question every day, and it's my job! [laughs]

Arshad:
[laughs] Yeah I'm the same. Do you also have family here?

Rick:
No, mine are all back in the States. My kids are doing really well in 
school and it would be too disruptive to move them out here right now.

Arshad:
True. What about you, Kiko? Do you have family in the country, too?

Kiko:
Uh [laughs], no, I moved to England by myself and I-

Arshad:
You know, my wife is looking to make new friends. 
I'll introduce you both to her.

What information did all three residents share about themselves?
job or studies, country of origin
Kiko didn't talk about her family.

Why didn't Kiko share much about herself? ü§î
Kiko's also not used to talking about her personal life to people she just met.

Also, in Kiko's culture, they wait until the speaker has finished 
before they start talking. 
However, Ash overlapped or interrupted the speaker few times 
as he grew up around people who do that.

There's a pause (silence) after Rick speaks before Kiko starts talking 
as she wanted to be sure he was finished first.

Before giving your name, you can say... "I (just) thought I'd introduce myself."
A response to "Nice to meet you" can be... "The pleasure's all mine."

I just thought I'd introduce myself.

How does Rick respond when Ash says, "Nice to meet you"?
The pleasure's all mine.

What do you... do for a living?
Have you... been here long?
Are you... enjoying it here so far?

Are you enjoying it here so far?
Have you been here long?

Kiko
Hi, Nicola. You're from Marketing, right? 
I thought I'd introduce myself. I'm Kiko from HR.

Nicola
Oh, yes! So you're Kiko! I've heard so much about you. 
Pleased to finally meet you! Are you enjoying it here so far?

Kiko
The pleasure's all mine. Oh, definitely. 
My team are just so lovely and supportive. Have you been here long?

Nicola
Almost a year, though I just moved home. Do you know where Salford Quays is?

Kiko
What a coincidence! I live in Quay Point. Have you heard of it?

Nicola
You're, like, a five-minute walk from me! We should get lunch sometime.

Kiko

I'd love that. It would be good to meet people as I came here by myself. 
My family are all back in Japan. What about you?

Nicola

I'm the same. It's just me and my cat here, though my family are just 
two hours away by car. I'm visiting them this weekend for a "hikeathon".

2. Asking for clarification - Ask for repetition and clarification

Can I check that I understand?
I just want to make sure.
"I just want to check." / "I just want to make sure."
"I just want to check/make sure." / 
"Can I just check/make sure I understand?"
You can choose either "check" or "make sure" in your sentence to clarify something.

he words that mean "to confirm".
check, make sure

More ways to clarify! ‚ûï
We can also use sentence stems (phrases that go at the start of 
a sentence) to check understanding. 

These aren't complete sentences, but you can say them before you 
reformulate (repeat what you heard but in your own way).

Check out the examples below.
So what you're saying is we're making less profit.
In other words, you're not ready!
Just to clarify, burro is not short for burrito?

"In other words..."
So what you're saying is...
Just to c l a r i f y ...

Tell me in your own words! üí¨
When you reformulate, try to avoid repeating what the person told you. 
Instead, use synonyms or a different grammar structure.

Have a look at the examples below and note how to reformulate 
what you were told. ‚¨áÔ∏è

what you hear
"Our expenses are up but our sales aren't."
"I just need 15 more minutes."
"You just ordered a donkey in Spanish!"

how you reformulate it
So what you're saying is we're making less profit.
In other words, you're not ready!
Just to clarify, burro is not short for burrito?

"Maddie said, "I'll have any non-meat dish." 
Just to clarify, she only wants the vegetarian option?"
I used different words to express Maddie's idea, for example, 
"vegetarian" instead of "non-meat".

"Tom told me, "The discount doesn't apply to us." 
Can I make sure I understand? Do we have to pay full price?"
I used different words to express Tom's idea.
"We have to pay full price" reformulates Tom's statement: 
"The discount does not apply to us."

The deadline's passed. - I just want to make sure. Is it too late to apply?
No steak, please. We're pescatarians. - Just to clarify, you only eat seafood?

"Sorry guys, they didn't pick us this week."
So what you're saying is we have to apply again next week.

Reformulate this sentence: 
"I'm postponing my announcement until the end of the week."
n other words, we need to wait until Friday to hear your news?

Damini calling Tanya from IT to access a file
***************************************
Damini: Any chance you could unblock it for me?

Tanya: To fix that, you need to get authorisation from Willow.

Damini: Sorry, I didn't catch that. Viro?

Tanya: No, W. I ..

Damini: Wi-Willow? Oh, Willow Taylor from HR?

Tanya: That's right. And give her your Piff JX code.

Damini: Uhh... Can you say that again for me? A Biff?

Tanya: Piff with a P. It's your unique PIN number.

Damini: Right. Just to make sure, is it the one with 5 spaces?

Tanya: Can you repeat that, please?

Damini: Like... 5 numbers or letters?

Tanya: Correct.

Damini: OK. I don't remember it. Sorry.

Tanya: That's fine. I can request a new one to be sent to you. 
What's your surname?

Damini: Furo.
.
Tanya: Sorry, what was that again?

Damini: Furo. F.U.R.O.

Tanya: Thank you. One moment please.

What word in both sentences did Damini ask Tanya to repeat?
Willow, Piff

I didn't catch that.
You can also say, "Sorry, I didn't catch that."

What was that again ?

say that again, repeat that
"Can you say that again?" / "Can you repeat that?"

Sorry, can you repeat that please?
Adding sorry and please can make your request more polite, 
which is common in spoken English!

Take a look at the examples below to see how you can use these words 
when asking for repetition.

(Sorry), can you say that again (please)?
(Sorry), what was that again?
(Sorry), can I check I understand?

Sorry, I didn't catch that.

Choose a question to ask the person to repeat themselves.
Can you say that again, please?
Sorry, can you repeat that, please|you please repeat that?

clarifying information - "So what you're saying is..."
asking for repetition - "Sorry, I didn't catch that."

In other words, you're not comfortable talking about your family in the beginning.

"Right, just to make sure, is it the one with 5 spaces?"
Tanya replied, "Can you repeat that, please?"
