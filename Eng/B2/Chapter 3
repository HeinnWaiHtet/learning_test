1. Reading about "hygge" - Transform adjectives and nouns

Have you ever heard of the Danish concept of hygge? 
🇩🇰 The word hygge has no direct translation, but it is the idea of comfort, 
contentment and feeling cosy. 🕯️

In this lesson we are going to learn some words associated with hygge 
before we read a text.

cosiness
Burning candles creates a feeling of cosiness.
"Cosiness" describes the pleasant feeling of comfort and warmth.

Candles and cosiness

Candles are associated with hygge and this feeling of cosiness, 
as they create a warm atmosphere. 
🕯️ In fact, people in Denmark burn more candles than anywhere 
else in the world!

For many people, hygge is about cosiness and comfort.
We need the noun form "cosiness" here, not the adjective form "cosy".

Hygge involves a bit of indulgence.

"Indulgence" is when you allow yourself to have something enjoyable, 
especially when it is not good for you. For example, cake! 🍰
🍰 Cake is my favourite indulgence!

Hygge involves a bit of indulgence.
We need the noun form "indulgence" here, not the adjective form "indulgent".

Cake is my favourite indulgence!
We need the noun form "indulgence" here, not the adjective form "indulgent".

warmth
Creating warmth is a big part of hygge.

Creating warmth is a big part of hygge.
The noun form of the adjective "warm" is slightly irregular: "warmth".

Denmark has cold winters, so creating warmth at home is essential!
We need the noun form "warmth" here, not the adjective form "warm".

gratitude
I feel a sense of gratitude when I am with my friends.
When we feel "grateful" or "thankful" for something, 
what we are feeling is "gratitude".

Let's read!

In the text, you will see the nouns we've just learned, and their adjective forms. 🔍

Noun            Adjective
cosiness        cosy
warmth          warm
gratitude       grateful
indulgence      indulgent

Hygge 🇩🇰

In 2016, "hygge" was named as one of the Oxford Dictionary’s words of the year.
But what is hygge?

The Danish-born concept of hygge has been called 
"the pursuit of everyday happiness." 
It is spending time with the people you love, it is indulgence, warmth, 
cosiness and gratitude. Hygge is part of Danish culture, 
but it is practised by people all over the world.

Hygge can involve some unhealthy eating. 
It’s a way to relax the rules, and treat yourself. 
Some people might choose an indulgent treat, like cake, chocolate or alcohol.

Because Danish winters are particularly cold, creating warmth is 
an important part of hygge. This includes burning candles at home 
to create a cosy ambience. Spending time with friends and family can add 
to this warmth.

Despite the cold climate, the Danes love to spend time outside. 
They might choose to walk or cycle to their destination, instead of driving. 
If it’s too cold to go out into nature, nature can be brought inside 
in the form of plants.

Through hygge, the Danes pursue happiness every day. 
They try to feel grateful for the smaller things in day-to-day life. 
It is no surprise, then, that Danes are known for their happiness. 
Denmark has been ranked as one of the world’s happiest countries many times. 
If we try and practise hygge every day, will we transform our lives 
for the better?

Hygge is about being warm and cosy
In the second paragraph, it says hygge is "indulgence, warmth, cosiness and gratitude".

Hygge can involve some unhealthy eating.
The Danish concept of hygge can help us find happiness in small things.
The text describes how small things (e.g. treats and gratitude) can bring daily happiness.

cosy
The only adjective here is "cosy", which means "warm and comfortable".

indulgent, indulgence
The adjective is "indulgent" and the noun is "indulgence".

Danes try to feel grateful for the smaller things in day-to-day life.
We need the adjective form "grateful" here, not the noun form "gratitude".

It’s the idea of being surrounded by the people you love, of indulgence, 
warmth, cosiness and gratitude.
We need the noun forms "cosiness" and "gratitude" here, not the adjective forms.

Spending time with friends and family can add to this warmth.
The noun form of the adjective "warm" is "warmth".

Some people might choose an indulgent treat, like cake, chocolate or alcohol.

2. The passive - Use the passive in different tenses

Hygge is part of Danish culture, but it is practised by people all over the world.
This sentence uses the passive form of the verb.

When do we use the passive?
We use the passive when we want to focus on who receives the action, 
not who does the action.
We often see the passive in academic or scientific writing. ✍️

🇩🇰 People know the Danes for their happiness.
active - focus on who ("people") does an action ("to know")

🇩🇰 The Danes are known for their happiness.
passive - focus on who ("the Danes") receives an action ("to be known")

Hygge is practised every day.
The passive focuses on the action, not who does the action.

"Indulgent food is often eaten".
We don't know who eats the food.

"Danes often eat indulgent food".
We know who eats the food.

In the sentence containing the passive ("Indulgent food is often eaten"), 
we don't know who eats the food.

How do we form the passive?
We use the verb "to be" plus the past participle of the verb.

Hygge is practised all over the world.

How do we form the passive?

We change the tense of "to be" depending on whether we're talking 
about the past, the present or the future.

In this lesson, we will practise the following tenses:

Present simple
"People all over the world practise hygge."
"Hygge is practised all over the world."

Present perfect
"He has written many books about hygge."
"Many books have been written about hygge."

Past simple
"She invited them to a dinner party."
"They were invited to a dinner party."

We were invited to a dinner party.
"We were invited..." is an example of a passive form.

"Hygge" was named one of the words of 2016. - passive
Linguists named "hygge" as one of the words of 2016. - active
The passive form is "Hygge was named", while the active form is "Linguists named...".

Hygge is practised by people all over the world.
The correct passive form is "Hygge is practised", as the active verb is 
in the present simple: "practise".

Hygge has been called the "pursuit of everyday happiness".
The correct form here is: "has been called". 
This is an example of the present perfect passive.

"Hygge" was named as one of the Oxford Dictionary’s words of the year.
In this sentence, "was named" is in the past simple passive form.

Hygge is practised by people all over the world.

(e.g. "is practised").

The Danes are known for their happiness.

The passive is formed using a form of the verb "to be" + past participle 
(e.g. "are known").

3. Discussing your lifestyle - Talk about self-improvement

Before we start...
You're about to hear a very authentic chat between two friends. Adriano and 
Sophie are not actors and their conversation is not scripted. 👨🏻 👩🏼

It may be a bit challenging, but you'll have subtitles, and you can slow down 
the video if you need to.

lifestyle - the way in which you live
a coach - someone who gives advice on a particular subject
motivated - inspired to achieve something

Adriano has been seeing a coach.
Adriano mentions that he's been seeing a new boxing coach.

He learned how much sleep he needs in order to have more energy.

I've bought a sleeping mask.
To help him sleep, Adriano says he bought a "sleeping mask" (to put over his eyes).

Adriano used to box in the past.
He says he can "go back to boxing" which suggests he did it in the past.

Adriano is happy with his new routine.

He says, "I think this is gonna be the new lifestyle" for him, 
so he seems happy with the routine.

"Since putting that mask on, I actually wake up super early...."
It's implied here that Adriano was waking up later before he started wearing the mask.

"Since putting that mask on, I actually wake up super early....
this allowed me to go back to boxing now"
Adriano says "this allowed me to go back to boxing", 
so waking up earlier has changed his behaviour.

Cause and effect
Adriano describes a relationship between his new sleeping habits and returning to boxing. 😴 🥊
We often use "because" and "since" to introduce the cause of another action 
or event (the effect).

Since I started running (cause), I've been feeling more healthy. (effect)
I can go on holiday (effect), because I've saved money. (cause)

Because I wake up earlier... - cause
...I can go to the gym. - effect
the cause = waking up earlier; the effect = going to the gym

Since putting that mask on... - cause
...I actually wake up super early. - effect
the cause = wearing the mask; the effect = waking up early

Since putting that mask on I actually wake up super early.
We often use "since" to introduce the cause of another action or event (the effect).

Sometimes we can identify a relationship between two actions 
or events without words such as "since" and "because".
I actually wake up super early (cause)...this allowed me to go back to boxing (effect).

his allowed me to go back to boxing now.
Sometimes we can identify a relationship between two actions 
without words such as "since" and "because".

This allowed me to go back to boxing now.
"This" refers to the cause, which is the fact that Adriano wakes up earlier now.

I actually wake up super early... - cause
This allowed me to go back to boxing. - effect
the cause = waking up early; the effect = going back to boxing

4. Features of informal speech - Navigate informal speech

Work is, you know, going well.
"You know" often does not add any meaning to a sentence. 
It's similar to "umm" or "err".

You know...

"You know" often does not add any meaning to a sentence. We sometimes use it 
like "um" or "uh" when we are thinking of what to say next. 🕒
I've been, you know, really busy studying after work.

Apart from that, everything's okay.
We use "apart from that" to talk about something which is an exception.

That's the thing, I don't have time!

That's the thing...
You might hear people saying "that's the thing!" before introducing a problem.
I'd love to exercise more, but I am too busy at work.
➡️ That's the thing! I don't have time to work out every day.

That's the thing! I don't have time to work out every day.
You might hear people saying "that's the thing!" before introducing a problem.

To be honest, I've been feeling quite low.
"To be honest" is often used when someone wants to express their opinions or feelings.

I suppose a holiday would be good for me.

I suppose...🤔
We use "I suppose" to show that we agree with something, 
but that we have doubts about it.

Come to the party! It will be fun.
➡️ Yeah, I suppose so.

Come to the party! It will be fun. Yeah, I suppose so.
We use "I suppose" to show that we agree with something, 
but that we have doubts about it.

"I suppose..." - agreeing but with doubts
"to be honest..." - talking about your opinion or feelings

"I suppose..." = agreeing but with doubts; 
"to be honest..." = talking about your opinion or feelings.

Apart from that, everything's, everything's okay.
That's the thing that I'm trying, I'm trying daily.
* We say "apart from that.." and "that's the thing".

Apart from that, um, everything's, everything's okay.
We use "apart from that" to talk about something which is an exception.

5. Opening and closing conversations - Catch up with a friend

Recently, we met friends Adriano and Sophie. 👨🏻 👩🏼

In this lesson, we'll watch just three short clips of their conversation, and 
focus on the language they use at certain moments. As you watch, think about:

👋 How they greet each other
🔀 How they keep the conversation going
🤗 How they end the conversation

Long time no see!

It feels like "ages" (a long time) since they last spoke.
I feel like it's been ages...

I feel like...🤔
You might hear people say "I feel like..." to talk about something they 
believe to be true (but aren't certain of).

How long has it been since we last saw each other?
➡️ Hmm, I feel like it's been a few weeks.

When's Jack's birthday?
➡️ I'm not sure, but I feel like it's in May.

Long time no see!

What about you?
And what about you?
What’s been happening on your end?

Here's a tip!
Adriano asks Sophie "What's been happening on your end?" which means 
"What's been happening in your life?"

We can also say "...on my end", "...on their end" and so on.
What's been happening on your end?
➡️ Everything's good on my end.


as it usually is. Same old, same old!
I'll let you go then!

Great to see that, and great to hear that.

Great to hear that!
We can say "great to hear (that)!" if someone has told you some positive news, 
and "great to see (that)!", when we can see evidence of something good. 
However, the expressions are often used interchangeably.

👂 It's great to hear that you like your new job!
👀 It's good to see all the work you've been doing.

Great to hear that!
I'll let you go then.

We've focused on ways people start, finish and keep a conversation going. ✅
We're going to hear these expressions one last time before the end of the lesson. 👨🏻 👩🏼

to start a conversation: "I feel like it's been ages!" "Long time, no see!"
to keep the conversation going: "What about you?" "What's been happening on your end?"
to finish a conversation: "Great to see that!" "I'll let you go then."

Sophie
Hey how are you? I fell like it's been ages, I think, since the last time 
I talked to you?

Adriano
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, nice to see you again! Long time no see, huh?

Sophie
How are you? How are things?

Adriano
Lots, lots of good stuff... And what about you? 
What’s been happening on your end?

Sophie
Uh I would say same old, same old, but no, work is, you know, is going well...

Adriano

that...perfect then, alright then I’ll let you go then, 
I've got some things to pick up on I’ve got a  quite a busy day.

6. Language recap - Review of recent lessons

Welcome back! 👋
In this review lesson we're going to focus on the language we've studied recently.
First, we'll read an email from Joseph to his mom. ✉️

Hey Mom,

How are you?
I've been super busy recently preparing my speech for a work conference. 
At first I was feeling pretty terrified about it to be honest... 
I find public speaking really difficult. 😰 
My colleague has been helping me prepare, and she's given me lots of helpful advice!
I've been practising my speech out loud to myself every day. 
Since I started practising, I've been feeling a lot calmer about it. 😊
Apart from that, things are fine, really. How's everything on your end? 
I've booked my flights home to see you and Dad at Christmas. 
It was great to see the pictures you sent of Dad's birthday party - 
looking forward to seeing you all!
Joseph.
