5. Negative and question forms of "to be"
Form questions and negative statements using the verb "to be"

Stan said "no, it wasn't fun", suggesting that his evening was not fun.
He wasn't busy.

To make the statement negative, we add "not" after "was" 
or "were". In speech, we usually shorten it using an apostrophe.

It was not late. = It wasn't late.
He was not busy. = He wasn't busy.
You were not tired. = You weren't tired.

We can contract the negative forms "was not" and 
"were not" into "wasn't" and "weren't".

They weren't at home yesterday. They were at the park.

She wasn't tired.
Margaret wasn't tired last night.

before the pronoun, e.g. "was it good?".

order of the sentence by placing a form of the verb 
"to be" at the start.

Were you late this morning?
Was your holiday fun?
Was he happy to see you?
Were you happy at university?
Were you stressed yesterday?

We place a question word before the verb.
