to repeat the noun that we are talking about.

This is my phone. It is mine.
Those are your glasses. They are yours.

This is our bag. It is ours.
These are their keys. They are theirs.

These new glasses are mine.

4. Finding someone's belongings
Learn how to ask about possessions using "whose"

Whose glasses are these?
We use the question word "whose" to ask who something belongs to.

whose
Whose wallet is this?

Whose keys are these?
To ask about plural objects, we can use the phrase 
"are these" after the question word "whose".

To ask who something belongs to, we can use the question 
word "whose" followed by the object we are asking about.

"Whose bag is that?"
"Whose glasses are those?"

Whose phone is this?
Whose books are these?
Whose phone is this?

Whose is that?
To ask about singular objects, we can use the phrase 
"is this" or "is that".

When we use "whose" to ask about ownership, 
we can choose to leave out the object we're asking about 
from the question.
We usually omit the object when we are holding it or can see it.

"Whose bag is this?"
"Whose is this?"

"Whose glasses are these?"
"Whose are these?"

To ask whether or not something belongs to a specific person, 
you can use the verb "to be" followed by a word like 
"this / that / these / those" and a possessive pronoun.

"Is this your phone?"
"Are those your keys?"

Is that yours?
The possessive pronoun for "you" is "yours".

Are those ours?
Is that theirs?
Are those mine?

Is that yours?
Whose phone is that?

Hello, my name is Tally and today, I want to show you around my flat.

I live here with my two rabbits, Maurice and Fern.

Tally:
So let’s start in my favourite room of the flat, 
the open-plan kitchen and living room.

I love how open this room is. When my friends come round, 
they can sit on the sofa while I cook and we can still 
talk to each other.

This is also where the rabbits live because I don't have a garden.

Tally:
My flat is quite small, so I just need to walk through the 
little hallway to take you through to the bedroom.

My favourite part of the bedroom is the big windows. This 
room gets lots of light in the mornings.

The desk is next to the window because I love feeling the 
sun on my back while I sit in my chair with my feet up on the bed.

Tally:
And as you can see, I love plants and flowers. I have lots 
in the kitchen and lots in the bedroom. I always put them 
up high so that the rabbits don’t eat them.

Everything in the bathroom is green, which is unusual, but 
I like it. And of course, I have more plants in here 
because they’re green too!

Thank you so much for watching this flat tour. Follow me 
on Instagram for lots of more cute pictures of the rabbits. Bye!


* Tally's kitchen is "open plan", so it is part of the living room.

g. "my hat", "your hat"), we can just say "That's mine." 😁

We can do the same with someone's name by adding "'s" at 
the end, e.g. "That's Anna's."

We use "'s" with the name at the end of the sentence, e.g. "Sarah's.
