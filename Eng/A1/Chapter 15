Well, I love playing football but I'm not very good. Actually, I'm looking for 
someone to play with, do you...

152 - Forming "wh" questions - Learn how to ask questions

We can use the following five words beginning with "wh-" to ask questions in English.

Who - to ask about a person / people
When - to ask about a time
Where - to ask about a place
Why - to ask about a reason
What - to ask about a thing / specific information
Which - to ask about one thing in a specific group

Who is coming?
When are you leaving?
Where do you go swimming?
Why do you get up early?
What are you doing?

We have already looked at how to form questions in various different ways.
These questions can be answered with "yes" or "no".

 She is happy.			Is she happy?
 You are living in France.	Are you living in France?
They play football.		Do they play football?

We can simply add one of the "wh" words we've just seen to the beginning of a 
question to ask about something more specific.
"Wh" questions can't be answered with "yes" or "no".
Do they play football?
Where do they play football?
When do they play football?
When do you go running?
What are you doing?

Who is coming?		Hayley and Jessie.
When are you playing?	At 7pm.
What are you doing?	I am working.

When do you do yoga?

When do you go swimming?
What sports do you do?

153 - Pronunciation: read or lead - Practise the sounds /r/ and /l/ in common English words

Can you hear the different consonants at the start of these words?

Pronunciation: /r/ and /l/

We are going to compare two consonant sounds, the /r/ sound in the word 
"really" and the /l/ sound in the word "like". You already know lots of words 
that contain these consonants, and by the end of this lesson it will be much 
easier for you to recognise and pronounce them!

Take a look at some more examples before we hear them:

/r/ sound		really, run, fries, room
/l/ sound		like, long, flies, love

/r/
1. Place your tongue close to the top of your mouth.
2. Curl the sides of your tongue and pull it back slightly so that it touches 
the top of your mouth.

/l/
1. Press the tip of your tongue against the back of your top front teeth.

Ella is reading.
Did you buy the light coloured shorts?
I really like ice cream.
I lead a book club. We read one book a month.
I hate long flights.
My dad ran a red light.

/r/ and /l/
/l/
1. Press the tip of your tongue against the back of your top front teeth.
/r/
1. Place your tongue close to the top of your mouth, touching the inside of 
your side teeth.
2. Push your lips slightly away from your face

I have a light for reading.
I really like cooking.
The children have a playroom.

12.4 - London Central: Episode 5 - Watch Leo get ready for work

I am late. It is 8am. Where is my uniform?
This is mine.
These shoes are mine.
That is yours.
Those shorts are yours.

We like to use fewer words when we speak, so we use "mine", yours, "his" etc.
When you don't want to repeat the object all the time (e.g. "my hat", "your 
hat"), we can just say "That's mine." üòÅ
We can do the same with someone's name by adding "'s" at the end, e.g. "That's Anna's."
"This shirt is mine."
"That dress is yours."

That is my... hat.
That hat is... mine.
This white top is Sarah's and this blue one is mine.
That's Anna's.
That isn't yours.
These are mine?
