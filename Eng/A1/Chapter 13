Hi everyone, my name is Tati and today I'm going to show you my typical morning routine as a student.
So let's get right into it! First my alarm goes off at 7 am and it's time to get up.
Usually I am very tired so this can take a while. 
After I get out of bed, it's time to have a shower. 
I prefer to shower in the mornings as it definitely helps me to wake up and feel refreshed for the day.
