For two-syllable adjectives ending in "y", 
change the ending to "-ier" to form the comparative.

For one-syllable adjectives that end in a consonant, we 
add an extra consonant + "-er". For example, "sad" becomes "sadder".

For two-syllable adjectives that end in the letter "y", 
the ending changes to "-ier". For example, "happy" becomes "happier'.

Add "-er".
