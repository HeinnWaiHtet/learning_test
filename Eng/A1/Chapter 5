My name is Leo. I am from Brazil.
Anna is Leo's new housemate in Janet's house.

We say "come in" or "come inside" to invite someone into our home.

I am excited to be in London.

Who are you?

Asking "Who are you?" is not too polite.
It is better to ask "What's your name?"

Her name is Georgina. She is English.
"Georgina" is her full name, but she uses the nickname "George", which is usually a male name.
