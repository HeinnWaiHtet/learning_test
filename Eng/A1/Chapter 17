Shopping

1. Checking opening times
Learn how to ask about store open times

What time do you open?
We can ask about a shop's opening and 
closing times if we plan to visit it.

We're open until 9pm.
This shop closes at 9pm.

The supermarket is open until 11pm.
You may hear the phrase "until" + time 
(until a certain time) to refer to opening times.

We're closed on Sundays.
She says, "The store is not open on Mondays."
This means it is closed on that day.

We're closed on Sundays and open on Mondays.
We're open from 10am to 8pm.

Claire's toy shop is open from 9am to 9pm tomorrow.
When giving a time range, we use the form 
"from" + time + "to" + time.

It's a good idea to check store opening 
and closing times as these can change 
on weekends and national holidays.

On Sundays, opening times are usually short, 
e.g. from 10am to 5pm.


Shops are usually closed on Christmas day (25th December).

The store opens at 10am every day, 
but on Sundays it closes at 4pm.

We're open from nine to five every day.
We can give a shop's opening times using 
the phrase "to be open from ... to ...".

We're closed on Christmas day.

3. Demonstrative pronouns
Learn how to use "this", "that", "these", "those"

That dress is $40.
We use "that" to refer to things / people 
that are further away.

How much is that?
Since "jacket" is singular, the answer is "that", 
because "those" only refers to plural nouns.

this, that, these, those
We use "this", "that", "these" and "those" 
to talk about specific objects / people. 
First let's focus on "this" and "that". 
"This" refers to something that is nearby, 
and "that" usually refers to something that is further away.

How much is this jacket?
I'll take that bag, please.

Referring to groups
We use "these" and "those" to refer to 
groups of objects or people. 
"These" refers to things that are nearby, 
and "those" refers to things that are further away.

people that are further away.

The pronoun "these" is used to refer to 
more plural things which are nearby.

"That" is used for one thing which is further away, 
and "those" is used for more than one thing.

The pronoun "that" is used with singular things: 
"shop", "water", "coffee", and "restaurant".

This is your table.

The pronoun "these" is used with plural objects: 
"shops", "tables" and "shoes".
These are $30.

Who are those people?
How much are these?
The speaker says "these", so he must be 
talking about more than one thing.

Can I have this dress, please?

That|This costs $40.
Are those your keys?
It's more natural not to repeat the word "keys" and 
not to say "Are those keys your keys?"

Those are $4 each.
The speaker says "those" to refer to 
a plural object that is further away.

I'll take these jeans, please.
Listen again to the pronunciation of "th" in "this".

How much are those|these?
The verb "are" means the object of the sentence is plural, 
so we can use "these / those".

4. Understanding the total price
Learn how prices are written and spoken

How much is this?
Excuse me, how much is this?
We can ask "How much is this?" to ask 
about the price of something.

It's $25 (dollars).
It's 10 dollars.
We usually say the number then the currency 
(in plural form) e.g. "10 dollars".

That comes to $50, please.
That comes to ¬£39, please.
The final price is ¬£39.
We use the phrase "to come to + price" 
to give the final total amount.

That comes to ‚Ç¨45.
The phrase "that comes to..." is another 
way of saying "the total amount is...".

When telling you how much you need 
to pay, the shop assistant might say:

That comes to ‚Ç¨30. (euros)
That's ¬£95 altogether. (pounds)
That's $48.50 in total. (dollars)

altogether, total
Phrases like "altogether", "in total" and 
"to come to" are used to give a final price

That is ¬£48.50 in total.
We use "in total" when giving the final 
price of something.

That's ¬£95 altogether.
The word "altogether" has a similar 
meaning to "in total".

That's $45 in total.
We either say: "that comes to + price" or 
"that's + price + in total".

How much... is this?
That comes to... ¬£39.
We use "to come to" to give the final  price of something. 

That's $40 altogether, please.

"altogether" or "in total".

5. Reading prices
Read prices on signs and price tags

a price tag
The price tag shows how much the shirt costs.
The price tag on this shirt says it's 25 dollars.

Attached to a product is a "price tag" 
that tells you how much something costs.

I can't see the price tag. How much is this bag?
The word "price" refers to how much something costs.

We usually see the currency symbol before 
the price number, e.g. "$10".
We say the price number before the currency name, 
e.g. "ten dollars" (10 dollars).

Currency
$20
twenty dollars
¬£5
five pounds
‚Ç¨10
ten euros

Example countries
the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia
the UK
Ireland

$10
We show the cost with the currency symbol 
before the number, e.g. " $10".

The symbol for euros is "‚Ç¨", which has  two lines in the middle.

The price in pounds is ¬£12.

CHASE'S
Trousers
Size: XL
Price: ¬£25 / ‚Ç¨28

These trousers are 25 pounds, or 28 euros.

The pair of trousers cost ‚Ç¨28.
The jacket costs $43.

Beware!
In the US, the price on the price tag is 
not the final price you will pay.
A "sales tax" is added at the cash register.
For example, the price tag might read 
"$30" but you might end up paying $32!

The price tag does not include "sales 
tax" so the final price is more.

The total price is $45.
The total price is the final cost of 
an item (including tax).
