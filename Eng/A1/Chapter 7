Food and Drink

7.1 - Going to a restaurant - Know what to say in a restaurant

Going to a restaurant
Could we have the menu, please?
Are you ready to order?
Can I book a table for two?
Can I have the bill, please?

We can use "Can / Could I have..?" to ask for anything. 
Have a look at the examples below.
Can we have the wine list, please?
Can we have a table by the window?
Can I have a jug of water, please?

Can I book a table?

Can I book a table for four?
Are you ready to order?
Can I have the bill, please?
Can we have a table by the window?

--------------------
7.2 - Polite requests - Introduction to modal verbs

In this unit we will look at the words "can", "could" and "may". 
We use these words when we ask for something.

Can you help me?
May I have the bill, please?
Could we have a jug of water, please?

can
Can I book a table for four, please?

could
Could I have some water please?

may
May we order?
May I have another drink, please?

"Could", "can" and "may" remain the same with all personal pronouns.

May / Can / Could I...?
May / Can / Could he/she/it...?
May / Can / Could we/they...?

Neither "can", "could" nor "may" change to match the personal pronoun.
May I have your phone number?

When we are making requests, “may” relates to permission, 
while “could” and "can" relate to possibility. 
However, in most spoken contexts, you can use all three.

"Can" = polite/informal
"Could" = more polite/more formal
"May" = most polite/most formal

When we make requests, we always put “can”, “could”, or “may” at the beginning.
Can we order some food, please?
Could they have a table by the window?
Can I book a table for four, please?
Could I have a glass of water please?
Could we have the wine list, please?
Could you help me, please?
Could I book a table for four, please?
Can I help you?
Can we have a jug of water, please?
May I have the bill please?
May we have the menu, please?

7.4 - Countable and uncountable nouns - Talk about foods and quantities

Countable and uncountable nouns

There are two types of noun that we're going to learn: countable and uncountable. 
As the names suggest, countable nouns are things that we can count and 
uncountable nouns are things that we can't. Let's look at some examples.

Countable: I have two sandwiches for lunch.
Uncountable: He eats pasta for dinner.

Countable nouns - Things that we can count, like "apples".
Uncountable nouns - Things that we can't count, like "milk".

Let's focus on countable nouns first. 
Typically, these nouns are the names of separate objects or people. 
They can be counted, so they have a plural form and we can use numbers or "some" with them. 
For their singular form, we can use "a" (or "an" before nouns beginning with a vowel).

Singular
Can I have an orange?
Would you like a sandwich?

Plural
I have three sisters.
There are some eggs.

countable : vegetables, sandwiches, drinks, teachers
Could I have two eggs, please?
There is a cake in the kitchen.
Can I have an apple, please?

a cake
an orange
two bananas

Uncountable nouns are the names of materials, liquids, abstract ideas 
and other things which do not have clear boundaries. 
We see them as masses without clear boundaries, and so we can't count them and 
they have no plural form. We don't use numbers or "a / an" with them, 
but we can use "some".

Who wants tea?
I want some food.
Do we have pasta?
Can I have some water?
milk, water, food

Who wants tea?
Would you like some coffee?

I'd like some pasta, please.
I drink coffee every morning.
We have two apples left.
Can I have some milk, please?



Here's a tip!

We say "there is / there are" when we want to express the existence or presence of something. 
We use:

- "there is (some)" with uncountable nouns,
- "there is a / an" with singular countable nouns,
- "there are (some)" with plural countable nouns.

Countable
There is a dog in the garden.
There are four people in my family.
There are (some) eggs in the fridge.

Uncountable
There is (some) coffee in the kitchen.

There is some bread in the freezer.
There are some vegetables in the fridge.
There is a football match at 3 o'clock.
There is some fruit in the bowl.
There are three bananas in this cake.
I have three brothers.
Can I have a drink, please?
Do you want an apple?
Can I have some milk, please?
There are 60 people at my company.
There is food on the table.
There is|There's|There is some|There's some milk in the fridge.
Can I have some fruit?
There is some|There's some pizza in the fridge.
Do you want some water?
There is one|There's one cookie left.
There are seven people in my family

7.5 - Quantifiers - Learn to express quantity

Quantifiers

We use different words to talk about quantities in English. 
These are called quantifiers.
I think I have a few apples.
I also need a little sugar.
We don't need much milk or many eggs.
How much butter do we have?

many
I have many apples.

There are many shops on this street.
* We use "many" because the noun "shops" is countable.

much
Is there much sugar in this cake?
You drink so much coffee in the morning!
* We use "much" because the noun "coffee" is uncountable.

a few
We only need a few eggs.

We need a few eggs to make the cake.
* We use "a few" because the noun "eggs" is countable.

a little
Do you want a little milk in your coffee?
Can I have a little honey in my tea, please?
* We use "a little" because the noun "honey" is uncountable.


Please buy some bananas. How many?
Please buy some milk. How much?
This is too much pasta. I can't eat it all!

How many raisins do I need? a few
How much butter do I need? a little

"much" and "many"
We use "much" and "many" to talk about large amounts, or to ask questions.
We use "much" with uncountable nouns (e.g "sugar"), and "many" with countable nouns (e.g. "chillis".
You will also see "so much" and "so many" often used for large amounts 
and "too much" and "too many" to talk about excessive amounts.

How much sugar do we have?
We have so much sugar!
I can't eat this, there are too many chilli peppers in it.

I have so many oranges.

"a few" and "a little".
****************
We use "a few" and "a little" to talk about small amounts. 
We do not normally use these to ask questions about how much there is of something.

We use "a few" with countable nouns 
(e.g. "potatoes", and "a little" with uncountable nouns (e.g "butter").

How many potatoes do we need for dinner?
Only a few potatoes, please.
Can I have a little butter, please?
Could I have a little sugar in my tea, please?

How many sandwiches do we need for the party? 
I think there are only 2 guests, so we just need a few sandwiches, right?

I have a few vegetables.
We use "a few" with countable nouns ("vegetables") to talk about small quantities of something.

How many eggs do we have?
Remember, we use "a lot of" in informal contexts with both countable and uncountable nouns.

I ate too much food at lunch.
We use "much" with uncountable nouns, so "food" is correct.

We only need a few apples for the cake.

"lots of" and "a lot of"

There are two ways of talking about large quantities that do not depend on countability: "lots of" and "a lot of".

These two phrases can be used instead of "much" or "many" when speaking about large quantities.

I have many sisters.
I have lots of sisters.
I have a lot of sisters.

You drink so much coffee!
You drink lots of coffee!
You drink a lot of coffee!
There are a lot of shops on this street.
There is a lot of sugar in this drink!

Be careful with "a lot of" and "lots of" - these expressions are often seen as less formal.
They are great to use when speaking, but in writing 
(especially in formal writing), they will not be appropriate.

Use "many" or "much" for professional writing.
Informal: She has lots of friends.
Formal: She has many friends.

more formal - There are many teachers at this school.
less formal - There are a lot of teachers at this school.

There are only a few apples in the bowl.
You have so many books!
You have so many books!
There are so many|many|lots of|a lot of people at this football match.
There is too much salt in this soup.
The speaker is unhappy because there is so much salt.
We have lots of homework every day.
I drink a lot of water.
There are too many|so many|many|lots of|a lot of cars here!

7.6 - Pronunciation: sheep or ship - Practise long vowel sounds in common English words

We are going to explore some common sounds that can be difficult for English learners to distinguish. 
Don't give up if you can't hear the difference at first! We'll prepare you in three stages:

1. Introduction to the sounds and video instructions for how to make them
2. Recognising and distinguishing the sounds
3. Producing the sounds

she (/i:/), it (/ɪ/)
Can you hear the different vowel sounds in these words?

Pronunciation: /i:/ and /ɪ/
********************
In English, some vowel sounds are long and some are short. 
For example, the vowel sound in "she" is long (/i:/) and the vowel sound in "it" is short (/ɪ/).
Let's focus on the difference between the vowel sounds: /i:/ and /ɪ/.
Long vowel sound /i:/: she, three, we
Short vowel sound /ɪ/: it, six, him

/i:/ This word has a long vowel sound.
three, we, meal, sheep, field

/i:/
1. Let your jaw drop slightly
2. Arch the top of your tongue up to the top of your mouth
3. Smile
4. Hold the sound

/ɪ/ -  short vowel sound.
six, it, ship, bit

/ɪ/
1. Relax your jaw
2. Arch the top of your tongue up to the top of your mouth
3. Put the tip of your tongue behind your front bottom teeth
4. Make a short sound

sheep, she, three, sheep, he
The word "sheep" contains a long vowel sound /i:/.
heel
The word "heel" contains a long vowel sound /i:/.
seat
The word "seat" contains a long vowel sound /i:/.

The long vowel sound is the same in "seat" as it is in "sheep", 
even though the spelling is different.

ship, hill, sit, it, hill, fill, his - a short vowel sound /ɪ/.

The heels are green.
That's a big ship.
Don't wear heels on a hill.
