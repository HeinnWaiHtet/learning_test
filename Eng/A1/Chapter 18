5. Continuous verbs
Learn how to form the continuous aspect

James is running very fast!
Continuous verbs end with "ing" and are used in sentences 
that describe current actions.

We add "ing" at the end of a verb create the continuous form.

If a verb ends in a "consonant-vowel-consonant" spelling pattern (e.g. "run"), we must double the last consonant, then add "ing".

Consonant-vowel-consonant verbs
to run – running
to sit – sitting
to put – putting

Sentence
I'm running right now.
Jan is sitting on the sofa.
The fish are swimming in the pond.

Mum is putting some jam on her bread.
The verb "to put" has a "consonant-vowel-consonant" pattern, 
so we add "t" and then "ing".

We are running.
Paolo is sitting on his bed.

Some verbs normally end in an "e", like "make". When we use these verbs in the present continuous, we remove the "e" before we add the "ing".

Verbs that end with "e"
to make – making
to live – living
to come – coming

Sentence
I'm making a video.
She's living in Italy.
Our taxi is coming.
I am having dinner with some friends tonight.
They're living with me, at the moment!

living - Remove "e" and add "ing".
running - Add a consonant and "ing".
studying - Just add "ing".

Are we having dinner at 7pm?

leaving
I can't go to the cinema now, I'm studying.
