Chapter 8: Business travel

Travelling for work
Talk about business travel

to go on a business trip
I have to go on a business trip to meet 
some important clients.

Once a year, I go on a business trip to our
headquarters. So I can meet all my colleagues 
from different cities.

Valerie uses "to go on a business trip" 
to mean "to travel for work purposes".

As a salesperson, I often go on business trips.
The word "trip" is countable, so we can say "trips"; 
"travel" is an uncountable noun.

to make travel arrangements

Before we go to Brussels, we need to make 
all the travel arrangements.

We need to make the travel arrangements for the conference.
We use "travel" here to describe the type of "arrangements".

We say "travel arrangements" to mean planning 
and preparations for a trip, such as buying tickets.

to book a taxi
I don't want to be late tomorrow morning, 
so I'll book a taxi now.

He has reserved a taxi.
We use "to book" to mean "to make a reservation".

Here's a tip!

We also use "to book" with other things apart 
from taxis, including:

to book a hotel room
to book a flight
to book a table at a restaurant

You can easily book a taxi before you travel, 
using this mobile app.
We say "to book a taxi" when we reserve it 
before we travel.

travel expenses
The company will pay all your travel expenses 
when you go to Dubai.

We say "travel expenses" for costs paid 
by your company when you travel for work.

Here's a tip!
1. We say "an expense" (singular) 
to mean the money you spend on something.

2. We say "expenses" (plural) to mean 
money you spend when you are working, 
that your employer will pay back to you.

1. Buying a car is a big expense.
2. My company is paying all my expenses on this trip.

I go on a lot of business trips, 
but my company pays the travel expenses.

When talking about money you spend 
when working, we use the plural form "expenses".

a company card
When I went to Rome, I used a company card 
to pay for all my meals and other expenses.

We say "a company card" for a corporate credit card 
used to pay expenses like dinners, flights etc.

We'll give you a company card to use 
for your meals and travel costs at the conference.

Exploring travel arrangements
Talk about flight arrangements

to fly business class
I always prefer to fly business class 
when I have a trip for work.

Here's a tip!
"Business class" is more expensive and 
comfortable than the regular "coach class" 
or "economy class", which is the cheapest way to fly.

"Business class" is cheaper than "first class", 
which is the most expensive way to fly.

I usually fly business class, 
as it's more comfortable than coach class, 
but cheaper than first class.

I've booked your tickets; you're flying business class.
We say "business class" for the area 
on the plane designated for business travellers.

to check in
It's an international flight, 
so I want to check in two hours before.

We use "to check in for a flight" 
when we officially confirm we are travelling before flying.

Here's a tip!
We say "to check in" when you let someone know 
you have arrived somewhere. So, as well as with flights,
 we use "to check in" with hotels.

Most people check in online before they get to the airport.
You have to go check in at the reception before you get your keys.

to depart
Flight 765 to Barcelona will depart in 15 minutes.

to arrive
Your flight is due to arrive in Barcelona at 15:35.

Here's a tip!
We say "to depart from" a city, country or airport.

We say "to arrive at" with most places, 
e.g. an airport or a train station, 
but we say "to arrive in" with a city or country.

We are departing from Barcelona in 20 minutes.
We are arriving at Manchester airport in 3 hours.
We are arriving in Manchester in 3 hours.

My flight leaves London at 9:50 and arrives
in Madrid two hours later.
The verb "to depart" means "to leave"; 
"to arrive" is the opposite.

I hope we depart from London on time.
I hope we don't arrive in Portugal too late.

We say "to depart from" and "to arrive in" 
with a city or country.

a destination
We have reached our destination. Welcome to London!

It's a long flight, so it will be late 
when I reach my destination.



I'm flying business class.

I've checked in online.

I'll arrive at my destination late.

We say "arrive at your destination" 
to mean "reach the place you are going to".

You have arrived at your destination.
Another way to say "to arrive 
at your destination" is "to reach your destination".

I'm flying business class. My destination is Rio de Janeiro.

You need to check in for international flights 
at least two hours before you depart.



The plane departs at 10.50 and arrives at 13.00 local time.

We need to check in two hours before we leave.

You need to hurry up.
