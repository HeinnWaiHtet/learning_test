1. Remembering childhood- Learn ways to talk about past habits

Steven talks about past events.
His grandfather was born in 1927 and he used to walk five miles to school every day.

"Used to walk" indicated that it happened regularly.

Learn "used to+infinitive" to talk about situations that continued 
for some time but don't happen anymore.
My grandfather used to live in a rural area.
"Used to" already contains information about the past and is followed by an infinitive.

My grandfather didn't use to go to school in spring and autumn 
when there was a lot to do on the farm.
The negative form of "used to" is "didn't use to" just like any other verb in the past simple.

Did he use to work on the farm?
We need "did you use to" to ask a question about a past habit.

At school, Steven's grandmother regularly learned domestic skills.
Steven's grandmother would learn how to make clothing, cook and bake.

When my grandmother was at school, she would learn domestic skills.
'Would" can be used to talk about repeated actions in the past.

When my grandmother was young, she would knit winter clothing for the whole family.
It's a sentence about a past habit that no longer exists.

"Would" or "used to"?
"Used to" describes actions and situations/states that continued 
for some time but don't happen anymore.

"Would" is only used with actions that continued 
for some time but don't happen anymore.

If you aren't sure which one to use, "used to" will always work.

Action                                  Situation/state
We didn't use to watch TV at all. ‚úÖ    As a child, she used to love singing. ‚úÖ
Back at school, we would play outdoors all the time.‚úÖ  As a child, she would live in Barcelona.‚ùå

She used to have short hair.
"Having short hair" is a situation, not an action. 
"Would" cannot be used here.

As children, we would ______ bikes.ride, paint, steal
"To ride", "to paint" and "to steal" are action verbs. 
They can be used with "would" to refer to a past habit.

Women of my grandmother's generation used to have domestic skills 
such as cooking and making clothing.
In this sentence, "have" is a state verb describing a situation 
and can only go with "used to".

would - to cook, to bake, to drive
used to - to know, to prefer, to study
"Used to" can be followed by any verb but "would" can only be followed by action verbs.

Three differences between childhood now and 100 years ago
1. ________
In the early twentieth century in the US, children were legally allowed to work. 
Countryside children would work on their family's farms 
while many children in cities and towns used to sell newspapers and 
food or work in mines or factories. 
They either built machines or worked with them. 
Today, children play with technology instead.

2. ________
Children‚Äôs photographs were nothing like what we see today. 
Portraits 100 years ago were unique. 
Children didn‚Äôt use to smile and they looked serious and unhappy. 
One possible explanation is that older pictures used to be blurry 
if people didn‚Äôt sit or stand still.

3. ________
Today, the school year lasts about nine months. 
In the late 1800s in the US, farm kids would go to school for only five, 
because parents needed children to help on the farm in spring and autumn. 
Even when the school year got longer and educating 
children became obligatory, farm kids used to be absent.

Paragraph 1 - Machines
Paragraph 2 - Photos
Paragraph 3 - School year

Children would work on their family's farms. = They often worked on their family's farms.

Older pictures used to be blurry if people didn‚Äôt sit or stand still.
"Would" is incorrect because "to be blurry" is a state.

Children didn‚Äôt use to smile and they looked serious and unhappy.
The negative form of the structure "used to" is "didn't use to" 
just like any verb in past simple.

My grandfather used to live on the farm, so he often missed school.
"Would" is incorrect because "live" is a state verb and 
describes a situation, not an action.

Many children in cities and towns used to|would|both sell newspapers and food.
would
"Sell" is an action verb and both "would" and "used to" are correct.
