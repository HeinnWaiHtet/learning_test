I don't read tabloids if I need a longer analysis of the news.

a headline
The headline read: "Hollywood star caught with no make-up on".
A headline is usually written in large letters at the top of an article 
and it's like a story's title.

Breaking news
A Viaggio bus has caught fire this morning in a neighbourhood in Senglea, 
Malta. It is the city's second major bus fire in just a month. The bus has 
been completely destroyed, and a nearby car has also been affected. In 
addition, the fire has caused a great amount of smoke that could be seen in 
much of the city.

What is the news about?
a bus fire
A Viaggio bus has burned this morning in Sanglea. 
It is the city's second major bus fire in just a month.

The bus has been completely destroyed.
The focus is on what happened to the bus, not who did it. 
That's why the passive voice is used.

The passive voice
The passive voice ("the bus has been destroyed") is very common in the news.
We use it because we don't know or do not want to say who performed the action.

The show was cancelled after the first season.
We don't know who cancelled the show.

A nearby car has been affected by the fire.

3. Direct speech - Revise tenses in direct speech in a news story

Harrison Anderson, 55, broke his arm in three places after being hit by a 
mobility scooter. His daughter, Daisy Stubbs, 25, accused the scooter driver 
of being careless. Ms Stubbs said, “The scooter was going really fast when it 
hit my father. He landed on his side and waited for an ambulance for three hours.”

The main point is that Mr Harrison was hit by a mobility scooter 
and was injured as a result.

Direct speech
Somebody's exact words are called direct speech.
You'll see it in the news all the time where there are quotation marks (" ").

Notice the variety of grammar tenses in direct speech.
Ms Stubbs said, “The scooter was going really fast when it hit my father."
the past simple and the past continuous

"I was walking down the street when the accident happened," said Mr Anderson.
* Direct speech is somebody's exact spoken words.

Variety of tenses
****************
Notice the variety of tenses and how they're used.

Past simple
I watched the news yesterday.

Present simple
I watch the news every day.

Future simple
I'll watch the news tonight. 

Past perfect
I had watched the news before I had dinner. 

Present perfect
I've just watched the news. 

Past continuous 
I was watching the news when you called. 

Present continuous
I'm watching the news now. 

Ms Stubbs said, “The scooter was going really fast when it hit my father."
It's a continuous action in the past that was interrupted by a shorter action 
– "It hit my father".

"My father landed on his side and waited for an ambulance for three hours,” Ms Stubbs said.
"Landed" and "waited" are two completed actions in the past 
that happened one right after the other.

Man hit by a careless mobility scooter driver
“After I’d watched the security video, I had no doubt that the driver was not 
paying attention because he was looking at his phone,” Mr Anderson told our reporter.

“My father is now recovering in hospital and will probably be there for the 
next two weeks,” Ms Stubbs added.

“The mobility scooter drove straight at Mr Anderson and the driver didn’t even 
stop and simply left the scene,” said a passerby who helped Mr Anderson.

“The regulation will have to change and become stricter. Mobility scooter 
riders should carry identification and be trained,” Mr Anderson said when 
asked about laws around mobility scooters.

Mr Anderson - He thinks the laws should be stricter.
The mobility scooter driver - He continued driving after the accident.

“After I’d watched the security video I had no doubt," Mr Anderson added.
There are two actions in the past. The one that happens first needs the past perfect.

"The driver was not paying attention because he was looking at his phone," 
said Ms Stubbs.
The past continuous ("wasn't paying") is used for actions that continued in the past.

“My father is now recovering in hospital," Ms Stubbs added.
It's about an action happening "now", so we need the present continuous.

"He will probably be in hospital for the next two weeks,” Ms Stubbs explained.
"The next two weeks" indicates that it's a future action.

“The mobility scooter drove straight at Mr Anderson," said a passerby.
The past simple form of "to drive" is "drove".

"The driver didn’t even stop and simply left the scene,” said a passerby.
The action happened in the past as we know that "the driver left the scene".

The regulation will have to become stricter.
It's a future sentence with "will" + infinitive.

"Mobility scooter drivers should carry identification and be trained,” 
Mr Anderson said.
"Should" is used to make suggestions.
