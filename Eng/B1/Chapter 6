1. Sports and events - Talk about sports and sporting events

Football is the most popular sport in the world, 
with an estimated 4 billion fans.
* "Football" is known as "soccer" in the United States.

American football is a tough, physical sport. 
In the USA, people don't call it "American football" - they just say "football."

cricket
Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world with over 2.5 billion fans, 
but it is not an Olympic event.

Only five sports have been part of every summer Olympic Games since 1896: 
Athletics, Cycling, Fencing, Gymnastics and Swimming.

The boxer Muhammad Ali is famous for saying, "I am the greatest".

Here are two useful phrases: “to be into something” and “to get into something”. 
You are into tennis means you like tennis or are interested in it. 
You are getting into tennis means you are starting to like tennis or becoming interested in it. 
We often strengthen these phrases with the word “really”. 
Check out these examples:

He is really into cricket at the moment.
I am not really into sports, to be honest.
She got into cycling during the Olympics.
I can't really get into boxing - it's too violent.

They are really into basketball.
She got into snowboarding last winter.

the World Cup
Pelé is the most successful player in the history of the World Cup - 
he lifted the trophy three times.

With five wins, Brazil are the most successful team in the history of the World Cup.

the Premier League
The Premier League is the highest level of the English football league system.

Do you prefer watching the World Cup or the Premier League?

We previously learned about the verbs we use with different sports. 
We use play for sports with a ball or similar object, 
go for sports ending in -ing, and do for martial arts and 
other recreational activites, as these examples show:

My brother plays football on Sundays.
We're going cycling next weekend.
My daughter does taekwondo after school.

You need a stick to play hockey.
You need boots to go hiking.
You need a mat to do yoga.
They are doing yoga.

the Tour de France
The world's biggest cycling race, the Tour de France, was first held in 1903.

the Super Bowl
American football's showpiece event, the Super Bowl, 
is usually the most-watched television broadcast of the year in the US.

Wimbledon
Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world.

Wimbledon - tennis
the Tour de France - cycling
the Super Bowl - American football

2. Superlatives - Describe sports events with superlatives

The best superlatives lesson ever

We've recently seen a lot of superlatives, so now is a good time to review and explore this topic. 
As we learned in A2, we use superlatives to describe the person or 
thing that is number 1 or first in a given category. 
heck out these examples:
Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa.
The Nile is the longest river on Earth.
Football is the most popular sport in the world.

The Tour de France is the biggest event in cycling.
Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world.
If you measure from sea level, Everest is the highest mountain on Earth at 8,848 metres.

How do we form the superlative?

Simply put, we add “-(e)st” to short words, and use “most” before long words. There are exceptions to this basic rule, which we will look at later.

Short words             Long words
old → the oldest        beautiful → the most beautiful
tall → the tallest      interesting → the most interesting
large → the largest     expensive → the most expensive

There are lots of tall buildings in this city, but that one is the tallest.
She's been to a lot of beautiful places, but she says Hawaii is the most beautiful.

If the word ends in "-y", we change the "-y" to "i" and add "-est". 
And if the word is, or ends with, a consonant-vowel-consonant cluster, we add an extra consonant.
happy → the happiest
easy → the easiest
hot → the hottest
thin → the thinnest

Monday is my busiest day of the week.
the thinnest phone in the world.

Before the superlative, we often use "the". 
But we can also use a word like "my", "your", "her" and so on, 
as these examples show:
What is your earliest memory?
This photo is my most important possession.
I'm a big Bowie fan - I think "Hunky Dory" is his best album.
Those running shoes are the cheapest shoes I own - 
they were only $10! The shoes I'm wearing now cost $100 - they're my most expensive pair.

Everest is the highest mountain above sea level, 
but many people say K2 is the most difficult to climb.
What's the funniest movie you've ever seen?
I love the colours in this one. I think it's his most beautiful painting.
The World Cup is the most popular sporting event in the world.

We can use the word "second" to describe the person or thing that is number 2 in a category.
K2 is the second highest peak in the Himalayas.
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world.
Baseball is the second most popular sport in the USA.
Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world, after football.

At almost 10 million square kilometres, 
Canada is the second largest country in the world after Russia.
My husband always orders the second cheapest bottle of wine on the menu.

Peru is the third largest country in South America.

The Nile is the longest river in the world.
Vatican City is the smallest country in the world.
Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world.
Angel Falls in Venezuela is...the highest waterfall in the world.
Russia is the largest country in the world.


Some exceptions to the rule
You probably remember that "good", 
"bad" and "far" don't follow the pattern we've just reviewed.
 Here's a recap:

good - the best
bad - the worst
far - the furthest / the farthest

The food used to be great here. 
It was one of the best restaurants in the city, but now it's one of the worst.
Which planet is the farthest from the Sun?

Some exceptions to the rule

There is a group of words that can take either "-est" or "most" in the superlative. 
These words all have two syllables (beats), for example "gentle". 
Below are some of the most common words in this group, one of which is the word "common"!

common - the commonest / the most common
cruel - the cruelest / the most cruel
gentle - the gentlest / the most gentle
handsome - the handsomest / the most handsome
likely - the likeliest / the most likely
narrow - the narrowest / the most narrow
polite - the politest / the most polite
simple - the simplest / the most simple
stupid - the stupidest / the most stupid

I still can't believe I overslept on my wedding day. It's one of...the stupidest things I've ever done!
Be careful here. This is the narrowest|the most narrow part of the cave.

This recipe for spaghetti carbonara is super easy - it's one of the simplest dishes out there!

She always says please and thank you. She's the most polite|the politest child I've ever met!

Here's one of the most useful phrases in English!

What do we say when a person or thing is not number 1, 
but is in the top 10 or perhaps the top 100? 
We have a couple of options, as shown below. Notice that the person or thing must be in the plural form:

He is one of the best footballers in the world right now.
He is among the best footballers in the world right now.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world.
China is one of the largest countries in the world.
For many people, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is among the greatest novels of the twentieth century.
The tiger is one of nature's most beautiful animals.

This movie didn't win any Oscars, but in my view it's still one of the best films of recent times.

among the fastest land animals on Earth.
Lions are among the fastest land animals on Earth.

3 - Mixed past tenses - Use the past continuous and the past simple together

Using the past continuous and the past simple together

You've seen these two verb forms before: the past continuous 
("was/were playing", "was/were going") and the past simple ("played", "went"). 
Now we will practise using them together to describe moments 
when two actions occurred at the same time, for example:
I was sleeping when the phone rang.
Our daughters got into kendo while we were living in Japan.

I was sleeping when the phone rang.
I watched the Super Bowl when I was visiting friends in Texas.
* We use the past continuous to describe a longer event which was in progress for some time.

Using the past continuous and the past simple together
The combination of past continuous and past simple has a couple of different functions. 
For instance, we use the past continuous to describe a longer event which was in progress for some time, 
and we use the past simple to describe a shorter action that interrupted it. 
To connect the two parts of the sentence, we use words like "when", "while" and "as". 
Here are some examples:
I was sleeping when the phone rang.
She called me while I was having dinner.
As I was driving home, I saw my old boss.
They heard a knock at the door.
My friend called me while I was having dinner.
She got a text as she was driving home.
She received a phone call.

Using the past continuous and the past simple together

We also use the past continuous to talk about temporary actions and situations. 
In contrast, we use the past simple to talk about completed actions or processes. 
Have a look at these examples:
Our daughters got into kendo while we were living in Japan.
I met him when I was working in Lagos.
She took lots of photos while she was travelling around Europe.
He played football every day when he wasn't working.
He made lots of friends while he was studying abroad.
While she was having lunch, she received some wonderful news.
She went swimming while she was staying at the hotel.
We found this cool new cafe while we were waiting for you.
I had a great idea while I was having a shower.
She was watching TV when suddenly there was a knock on the door.
As I was cycling to work, a cat ran across the road in front of me.
While I was walking in the park, I saw my best friend from high school.
We were having a picnic when suddenly it started to rain.
Hey, Dad. Mum texted you while you were making dinner.
