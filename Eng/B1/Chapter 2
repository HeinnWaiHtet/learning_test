Trips abroad

2.1 Future forms - Review future forms with "will" and "going to"

What are you going to do this weekend?
Since the subject of the sentence is "you", we use "are going to" instead of "is going to".

"will" vs. "be going to"
We can use either will or be going to in most contexts. Choosing one or the other doesn't usually affect meaning, but if you want to sound more fluent you should be aware of these points:

Prior plan: I am going to fly home on Sunday.
Quick decision: Great, I will pick you up from the airport.
About to happen: I should say goodbye now. My phone is going to run out of battery.
Prediction: Take care! I'm sure you will have a great time. / Take care! I'm sure you are going to have a great time.

That bag looks heavy. I'll help you.
The speaker saw the bag and made a quick decision to help, so they say "I'll help you."

Select the best response to this statement: "Look, here comes your suitcase!"
I'll get it!

We are going to go on a city break next month.
This sentence refers to a prior plan in the future, so the "be going to" form is used.

Don't worry if you mix up will and be going to - people will still understand you. The important thing is knowing how the two forms fit into sentences - for example, using the correct form of "be". Let's practise!

My friend and I are going to go to the night market on Saturday.
We say "are going to" here so that it agrees with the "we" form of the verb "to be": "are"

I think the food in Argentina will be spicy.
This sentence is making a prediction about the food on a future trip, so the form "will" is used.

Have you seen the weather forecast? It's going to rain heavily tomorrow.
It's contains the third person form of "to be" (is), so here we follow it with "going to".

My scuba diving trip to Egypt was really fun. I will show you some photos later!

When we have confirmed plans, we often use the present continuous instead of be going to. Check out the following examples:

I am going to go on a trip tomorrow.
I am going on a trip tomorrow.

They are going to move house soon. 
They are moving house soon.

He's not going to join us for dinner. 
He's not joining us for dinner.

A: What are you doing next weekend?
She's asking about her friend's plans for the weekend, so she uses the "present continuous".

I'm visiting friends in Istanbul next weekend.
We can also say "I'm going to visit friends...".

Here's a summary!

We have seen three ways to talk about the future. Check out the summary below, then continue practising!

will                    I will book the tickets tonight.
be going to             I'm going to book the tickets tonight.
present continuous      I'm booking the tickets tonight.

Are you going to go somewhere nice this summer?
To talk about future holiday plans that aren't confirmed yet, we use: "Are you going to go..."

We're going to Thailand for two weeks in August.
Here, the preposition "to" is required before the place "Thailand".

You book the flights and I'll book the hotel.
The correct future form here is: "I'll book".

I am going to go on vacation.
She is going to go on vacation.
We are going to go on vacation.

The staff were nice but the rooms were small and dirty - we won't stay there again.
We want to use the shortened negative form of "will not", which is "won't".
