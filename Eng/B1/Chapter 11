Passions

1. Describing your passions - Talk about the things you love and hate

to be fond of
I became fond of cats when I realised how intelligent they are.

to be crazy about
I'm crazy about these kittens. They're so cute.

We use "be fond of" and "be crazy about" to say that we like something.

Cats are so adorable. How can you not be crazy about them?
We say "crazy about" but "fond of". The preposition is different.

I don't mind.
I don't mind being around cats but I don't want to own one.

It's all the same to me.
It's all the same to me if we get a cat or a dog.

I can't bear it.
I'm allergic to cats and I can't bear being around them.

"Don't like at all" and "can't bear" are used to talk about things we strongly dislike.

I don't like cats at all.

to like - I'm fond of it.
to dislike - I can't bear it.
to neither like or dislike - I don't mind.

to be keen on
I live with 1000 cats so obviously I'm keen on them.

"Be keen on" and "be fond of" have similar meanings but they take different prepositions.

be keen on
be crazy about
be fond of

2. Understanding someone talk about their passion - Watch a video about a woman who rescues cats

Lynnea runs a cat home.
Lynnea must be crazy about cats.
She had to move to a smaller house.

It's all the same to Lynnea that she had to give up a big house with a swimming pool.
She has a group of employees.
She doesn't mind starting work at 4am to feed the cats
Some weren't so keen on cats when they started.
This cat doesn't know when to stop eating. He's so fond of cat food.

Once she has made sure that they are happy and ‚Äãhealthy‚Äã, 
Lynnea g‚Äãives‚Äã them ‚Äãaway to families who contact her online.

4. Narrative tenses - Combine tenses to tell a story

Watch out for these tenses. üëÄ
When we tell a story, we use a variety of tenses to describe different actions.

Past simple
a finished action
used with ago, yesterday, last week
I moved to Dublin five years ago.

Past continuous
an action that continued for some time and was often interrupted by a short action
used with while
I was living in Dublin when the accident happened.

Present perfect
a recent action with an effect in the present
used with yet, already, this week
I've just bought these plane tickets.

Past simple
It was a wonderful August morning two years ago.
The action is finished (two years ago), so we need the past simple, "was". 
"Has been" would be for a recent action.

Past continuous and past simple
I was lying in my bed when I suddenly heard my mum‚Äôs angry voice.
"I was lying" is a longer action that was interrupted. 
"Suddenly" suggests that "heard" is a shorter finished action.

Present perfect
What? You haven‚Äôt packed your suitcase yet?
"Yet" shows that it happened (or didn't happen) at some unknown time 
but has an effect in the present.

"I've washed the car" is a recent action and 
the results are seen in the present.

There are three short finished actions in the sentence.
I went downstairs, hugged my mum and gave my dad a big kiss. 
These actions are in the past simple.

My parents were laughing and hugging again. 
"Were + -ing" suggest that these actions continued for some time.

The Little Superhero
Yes, I‚Äôm a superhero. I saved an elderly lady once, 
and quite recently I‚Äôve used my superpowers on my grandmother. 
But my biggest moment was saving our summer holiday.

It was a wonderful August morning two years ago. 
I was lying in my bed thinking about the beach, the sea, the ice cream 
when I suddenly heard my mum‚Äôs angry voice: 
‚Äú What? You haven‚Äôt packed your suitcase yet? We‚Äôre leaving in two hours, a
nd the kids are not ready yet. It‚Äôs so typical of you, 
doing everything at the last minute.‚Äù 
She was going to continue, but my father interrupted her. 
He sounded angry too. 
‚ÄúWell, I haven‚Äôt packed my suitcase because I was preparing snacks for the 
road, and also, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve noticed, but I‚Äôve washed the car."

‚ÄúYou know what. I‚Äôm cancelling the holiday: we‚Äôre not going anywhere,‚Äù 
my mum said. The situation was getting dangerous, 
and my parents were out of control. 
I needed to save the summer holiday. I needed to use my superpower.

I went downstairs, hugged my mum and gave my dad a big kiss. 
‚ÄúMummy, daddy, I see you‚Äôre very upset. Just take a little break to cool 
down.‚Äù They sat down on the sofa and soon were laughing and hugging again.

better, the cast rarely has Latino characters.

State verbs describe states (opinions, states and senses) not actions 
and they don't usually take the continuous form.

Example

to agree, to believe, to seem, to understand, to think

feelings
to hate, to like, to want

senses
to look, to see

Nollywood makes more movies than Hollywood.

The Nollywood industry is changing. First, the films were low quality, 
but now they are more and more professional.

It came out in 2016 and is still popular.

their traditional Nigerian wedding. 
There are many characters in the film but I definitely enjoyed watching Zainab Balogun. 
She played the role of a wedding planner who was desperately trying t
o save the wedding when everything started to go wrong. 
Even though the plot is simple, the film is very funny and 
I personally liked the cast, too.
