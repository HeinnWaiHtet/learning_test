to neither like or dislike - I don't mind.

4. Narrative tenses - Combine tenses to tell a story

Watch out for these tenses. üëÄ
When we tell a story, we use a variety of tenses to describe different actions.

Past simple
a finished action
used with ago, yesterday, last week
I moved to Dublin five years ago.

Past continuous
an action that continued for some time and was often interrupted by a short action
used with while
I was living in Dublin when the accident happened.

Present perfect
a recent action with an effect in the present
used with yet, already, this week
I've just bought these plane tickets.

Past simple
It was a wonderful August morning two years ago.
The action is finished (two years ago), so we need the past simple, "was". 
"Has been" would be for a recent action.

Past continuous and past simple
I was lying in my bed when I suddenly heard my mum‚Äôs angry voice.
"I was lying" is a longer action that was interrupted. 
"Suddenly" suggests that "heard" is a shorter finished action.

Present perfect
What? You haven‚Äôt packed your suitcase yet?
"Yet" shows that it happened (or didn't happen) at some unknown time 
but has an effect in the present.

"I've washed the car" is a recent action and 
the results are seen in the present.

There are three short finished actions in the sentence.
I went downstairs, hugged my mum and gave my dad a big kiss. 
These actions are in the past simple.

My parents were laughing and hugging again. 
"Were + -ing" suggest that these actions continued for some time.

The Little Superhero
Yes, I‚Äôm a superhero. I saved an elderly lady once, 
and quite recently I‚Äôve used my superpowers on my grandmother. 
But my biggest moment was saving our summer holiday.

It was a wonderful August morning two years ago. 
I was lying in my bed thinking about the beach, the sea, the ice cream 
when I suddenly heard my mum‚Äôs angry voice: 
‚Äú What? You haven‚Äôt packed your suitcase yet? We‚Äôre leaving in two hours, a
nd the kids are not ready yet. It‚Äôs so typical of you, 
doing everything at the last minute.‚Äù 
She was going to continue, but my father interrupted her. 
He sounded angry too. 
‚ÄúWell, I haven‚Äôt packed my suitcase because I was preparing snacks for the 
road, and also, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve noticed, but I‚Äôve washed the car."

‚ÄúYou know what. I‚Äôm cancelling the holiday: we‚Äôre not going anywhere,‚Äù 
my mum said. The situation was getting dangerous, 
and my parents were out of control. 
I needed to save the summer holiday. I needed to use my superpower.

I went downstairs, hugged my mum and gave my dad a big kiss. 
‚ÄúMummy, daddy, I see you‚Äôre very upset. Just take a little break to cool 
down.‚Äù They sat down on the sofa and soon were laughing and hugging again.
