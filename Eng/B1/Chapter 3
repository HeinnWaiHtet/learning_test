3.3 - Comparing places - Compare travel destinations

The hotel in Beijing was nicer than the one in New York.
* The comparative form "was nicer than" indicates the speaker's comparing two hotels.

We form comparatives in two different ways:
1. one-syllable adjective + "-er" ending + "than"
2. "more/less" + adjective of 2 or more syllables + "than"

1. Mexico City is warmer than Toronto.
2. The hotel in Chicago was less luxurious than the hotel in Moscow.

Trams in Rome are slower than trams in Amsterdam.
* Since "slow" is a short word with one syllable, its comparative form is "slower".

Our last trip was more enjoyable than this one.
* We use the comparative form "more enjoyable" here. We use "most" with superlatives.

noisier than
The restaurant is noisier today than it was yesterday.

Don't forget!
Adjectives ending in "-y" change their ending to "-ier" in a comparison.
When an adjective ends in a vowel + a consonant, we double that consonant before adding "-er".

happy - happier
big - bigger

Shanghai is bigger than Paris.
* To make "big" comparative, we add another "g" as well as the ending "-er": "bigger".

There are some irregular comparative adjectives:
good - "better"
bad - "worse"

Food in Italy is better than food in the U.K.

Did you notice?

We can use "more / less ... than" to compare nouns to each other. We use "fewer" instead of "less" when the noun is countable.
There are more bicycles in Amsterdam than in Warsaw.
There are fewer people in St Petersburg than in Moscow.
There is less snow in Snowdonia than in the Alps.

There are more beaches in Australia than in France.
* Since "beaches" is a countable noun, we can use "more/fewer" + noun + "than" to make a comparison.

There were fewer museums than I expected.
* Since "museums" is a countable noun, we use "fewer" (and not "less").

I enjoyed the tour of the Louvre. It was bigger and more interesting than I expected.
* She says "it was more interesting than I expected", so she enjoyed her museum visit.

I expected lots of tourists, but Gdansk was more peaceful than I thought!
* We can't use "fewer" to describe Gdansk, as it's not a plural noun. We use "than" in comparisons

In my opinion, the centre of Vienna was less old-fashioned than Prague.
* We use "less" to modify the adjective ("old-fashioned") in this comparative sentence.

as many as
James brought as many bags as Juliana.

Here's a tip!
To say that two things are equal in some way, we say that something is "as" + adjective + "as" something else.
When we talk about equal quantities, we say "as many" + noun + "as". Let's look at some examples:

Istanbul is as crowded as London.
There are as many museums in Athens as in Rome.
Sebastian is as excited as Ana.

Our trip to Peru was as wonderful as our trip to Colombia. I love South America!
* She uses the adjective "wonderful", indicating that her trips to Peru and Colombia were positive.
