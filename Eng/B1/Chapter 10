1. Second conditional - Use the second conditional

If I had time, I would be there!

We use the second conditional to talk about hypothetical situations and their consequences.
We use it to talk about situations that are unlikely or imaginary, 
and what would happen if those situations were true.

If I wasn't busy this weekend, I would come to your graduation.
I would buy some new shoes if I had enough money this month. 

If I had space in the car, I would drive you to the party.
We use "would / wouldn't" + infinitive to talk about hypothetical present consequences.

I would give a speech, if I wasn't so nervous.

The second conditional has two parts:
"If" and the past simple introduce a hypothetical situation.
"Would" and the infinitive introduce the consequence of that hypothetical situation.
Either part can go first in the sentence.

f I had time (hypothetical situation), I would buy an outfit for the party (consequence).
You would enjoy the party (consequence) if you knew more people (hypothetical situation).

If I had time, - hypothetical situation
I would buy an outfit for the party. - consequence
If I didn't have a full car, I'd drive you to the party

We often use the contracted form of "would" ('d) when forming the second conditional.

If I didn't have a full car, I'd drive you to the party.
If Omar had time, he'd cut his hair before the wedding.
If I owned a suit, I 'd wear it.

If they had fewer plus-ones - hypothetical situation
there'd be more space in the venue. - consequence

We can use the second conditional construction to ask polite questions:
Would it be alright if I brought a plus one?

Would it be helpful if I gave grandpa a lift to the party?

Would it be alright, if I went home early?
Ellie wouldn't be able to go out if she had work tomorrow.

If they didn't invite her, Lucy would be upset.
If I had more time, I'd find a football club and join a team.
If Ella had more money, she would visit her best friend in Australia!

If I had enough money, I'd buy a new car.
James would pay his student loan if he earned more money.
If my parents won the lottery, they would move abroad!
If I didn't work, I would travel the world.
If you had time, would you take French classes?

When introducing a hypothetical situation we use "were", 
especially when we use the second conditional to give advice or make suggestions. 
Occasionally, you may see "was" in its place.

If the week were 8 days long, Adam would visit his parents more often.
If I were you, I'd wear a suit.
If I were you, I'd try to get away for a while!
Would you buy this car if it were cheaper?
If I didn't work, I would travel the world.

2. Going to a festival - Get the most out of the festival experience

a wristband
First, you show your ticket to get your wristband, 
then you show your wristband to get into the festival.

camping
If you're planning on camping at the festival, 
don't pitch your tent near the toilets - the smell and slamming doors 
will give you sleepless nights!

Don't lose your wristband! You need it to get into the festival.
A "wristband" is a strip of material on your wrist used for identification at festivals.

glamping
Glamping - a blend of "glamorous" and "camping" - 
is a bit like traditional camping, but more luxurious.

a headliner
The organisers have just announced the headliners for next year's festival.

Camping is often included in the ticket price.
Glamping costs extra but is more comfortable.

"glamping" means "glamorous camping" and it involves comforts such as beds and electricity.

"My favourite band is headlining" means that the speaker's favourite band is the main act.

a VIP / a very important person
We're paying extra to get the VIP treatment: backstage passes, 
glamping and - best of all - hot showers!

a genre
Some festivals specialise in one musical genre, while others have a bit of 
everything: stadium rock, laid-back hip-hop, DJs, you name it.

How much would it cost to get the VIP treatment?
I like good music no matter what genre.
* "genre of music" is a style of music, e.g. rock or jazz.

sunscreen
Sunscreen protects your skin from the sun's rays. Some people call it 
suncream or suntan lotion.

wellies
Wellington boots, or wellies for short, are called galoshes in the USA. 
They are also known as rain boots and gum boots in some areas.

a food truck
The food at this festival is awesome! 
Have you tried the falafel truck near the acoustic stage?

I'm not sure what the weather will be like, so I'm packing some sunscreen 
and I'll wear my wellies to save space in my bag.

A "food truck" is a truck that prepares and sells food.

a headliner - famous act that performs last
wellies - waterproof footwear
a wristband - wearable pass for entering a festival

Take walking boots and wellies.
Rain flows from high ground to low ground, so I recommend camping on high ground if you can.

You'll be outside for most of the day, so make sure you pack the sunscreen!
the variety of performances and the atmosphere
* Glastonbury has an amazing energy and it's not just about music but also 
comedy, dance and theatre.

Catch your three favourite bands, then relax.
You need your wristband to get into the festival.

If you like the sound of camping but don't want to get your hands dirty, 
why not try glamping?

Some travel agents sell VIP passes for Glastonbury, but they're incredibly expensive.

The main stage is cool but don't miss the smaller stages.
You get your wristband when you arrive at the festival.

I burn really easily so I'd better take some sunscreen.
There's rock, indie, hip-hop, techno... Basically every genre you can think of.
* "genre of music" is a style of music, e.g. rock or jazz.

I'll meet you at that vegan food truck in 20 minutes!
I think camping looks uncomfortable, but I'm willing to try glamping.
I don't need the VIP treatment. I would rather camp with everyone else.
Have you been to a festival before?
It's going to rain so we should definitely take our wellies.
If you leave the festival site for any reason, you'll need to show your wristband to get back in.
The main performer usually appears towards the end of the day and is known as the headliner.
Can you remember where we pitched our tent? Is this even the right camping area?
The more comfortable and luxurious version of camping is known as glamping.
