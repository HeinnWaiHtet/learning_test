Festivals

1. Second conditional - Use the second conditional

If I had time, I would be there!

We use the second conditional to talk about hypothetical situations and their consequences.
We use it to talk about situations that are unlikely or imaginary, 
and what would happen if those situations were true.

If I wasn't busy this weekend, I would come to your graduation.
I would buy some new shoes if I had enough money this month. 

If I had space in the car, I would drive you to the party.
We use "would / wouldn't" + infinitive to talk about hypothetical present consequences.

I would give a speech, if I wasn't so nervous.

The second conditional has two parts:
"If" and the past simple introduce a hypothetical situation.
"Would" and the infinitive introduce the consequence of that hypothetical situation.
Either part can go first in the sentence.

If I had time (hypothetical situation), 
I would buy an outfit for the party (consequence).
You would enjoy the party (consequence) 
if you knew more people (hypothetical situation).

If I had time, - hypothetical situation
I would buy an outfit for the party. - consequence
If I didn't have a full car, I'd drive you to the party

Did you notice‚ùì
We often use the contracted form of "would" ('d) 
when forming the second conditional.

If I didn't have a full car, I'd drive you to the party.
If Omar had time, he'd cut his hair before the wedding.
If I owned a suit, I 'd wear it.

Joe would know what time the wedding starts...
if he looked at the invitation.

If they had fewer plus-ones - hypothetical situation
there'd be more space in the venue. - consequence

We can use the second conditional construction to ask polite questions:
Would it be alright if I brought a plus one?

Would it be helpful if I gave grandpa a lift to the party?

If they didn't invite her, ...Lucy would be upset.

I would buy some new shoes, if I had enough money this month.
Luis is talking about a hypothetical situation.

Would it be alright, if I went home early?
Ellie wouldn't be able to go out if she had work tomorrow.

If they didn't invite her, Lucy would be upset.
If I had more time, I'd find a football club and join a team.
If Ella had more money, she would visit her best friend in Australia!

If I had enough money, I'd buy a new car.
James would pay his student loan if he earned more money.
If my parents won the lottery, they would move abroad!
If I didn't work, I would travel the world.
If you had time, would you take French classes?

Did you notice?
When introducing a hypothetical situation we use "were", 
especially when we use the second conditional 
to give advice or make suggestions. 
Occasionally, you may see "was" in its place.

If the week were 8 days long, Adam would visit his parents more often.
If I were you, I'd wear a suit.
If I were you, I'd try to get away for a while!
Would you buy this car if it were cheaper?
If I didn't work, I would travel the world.

2. Going to a festival - Get the most out of the festival experience

a wristband
First, you show your ticket to get your wristband, 
then you show your wristband to get into the festival.

camping
If you're planning on camping at the festival, 
don't pitch your tent near the toilets - 
the smell and slamming doors will give you sleepless nights!

Don't lose your wristband! You need it to get into the festival.
A "wristband" is a strip of material on your wrist 
used for identification at festivals.

glamping
Glamping - a blend of "glamorous" and "camping" - 
is a bit like traditional camping, but more luxurious.

a headliner
The organisers have just announced the headliners for next year's festival.

Camping is often included in the ticket price.
Glamping costs extra but is more comfortable.

"glamping" means "glamorous camping" and it involves comforts such as beds and electricity.

"My favourite band is headlining" means that the speaker's favourite band is the main act.

a VIP / a very important person
We're paying extra to get the VIP treatment: backstage passes, 
glamping and - best of all - hot showers!

everything: stadium rock, laid-back hip-hop, DJs, you name it.

They are also known as rain boots and gum boots in some areas.

a food truck
The food at this festival is awesome! 
Have you tried the falafel truck near the acoustic stage?

I'm not sure what the weather will be like, 
so I'm packing some sunscreen 
and I'll wear my wellies to save space in my bag.

A "food truck" is a truck that prepares and sells food.

a headliner - famous act that performs last
wellies - waterproof footwear
a wristband - wearable pass for entering a festival

Take walking boots and wellies.
Rain flows from high ground to low ground, 
so I recommend camping on high ground if you can.

You'll be outside for most of the day, 
so make sure you pack the sunscreen!
the variety of performances and the atmosphere
* Glastonbury has an amazing energy and it's not just 
about music but also comedy, dance and theatre.

3. Intensifiers - 
Use words like "really" and "very" to describe experiences

Basic intensifiers

We use intensifiers - words like "very" and "really" 
- to strengthen adjectives ("friendly", "difficult", "great").
The people here are very friendly.
The test was so difficult.
We had a really great time at Glastonbury.

The president is a very important person.
"very" intensifies the meaning of the word it goes with.

She's such a good friend. She's so supportive.
We use "such" with a noun phrase (as in "such a good friend"), 
and we use "so" with an adjective (as in "so supportive").

The food at the festival was so tasty!
We use "so" with an adjective.

My hometown is really small.
"really" intensifies the meaning of the word it goes with.

Advanced intensifiers

These are some more advanced intensifiers. 
They indicate that something is done to a high degree or to the fullest degree.

High degree

Fullest degree
completely, absolutely, totally

absolutely

but I couldn't have done it without the help of my co-workers.

There was so much to see and do!

"absolutely" intensifies the meaning of "amazing".

Some events at the Edinburgh Festival are completely free.

Be careful when using "very"
We use "very" with adjectives like "big". 
We don't usually use "very" with stronger adjectives like "enormous" 
(which means "very big"). With strong adjectives like "enormous", 
we use intensifiers like "really", "absolutely", "completely" and so on.

very big, very small, very good, very bad 
absolutely enormous, absolutely tiny, really great, completely awful

The restaurant had a nice atmosphere, but the food was completely awful.
With strong adjectives like "awful", we use intensifiers like "really" or 
"completely", but not "very".

I'm extremely proud of this group of players.

totally
Don't worry if you feel stressed sometimes, that's totally normal.

Even today, The Beatles are still incredibly popular.
"incredibly" has a similar meaning to "very".

No worries, that's totally fine.
"totally" is used before the adjective "fine".

Using intensifiers with particular adjectives

Some intensifiers pair only with particular adjectives and they cannot be used interchangeably.

highly
skilled, unlikely, recommended, paid

totally, completely, absolutely 
new, different, dry, free, right 

extremely, incredibly
easy, expensive, busy, helpful, powerful

A Traveller‚Äôs Guide to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival
Would you like to go to the Edinburgh Fringe? 
This blog post will tell you everything you need to know 
about this incredibly fun and popular arts festival!

What is the Edinburgh Fringe Festival?
The Edinburgh Fringe is the world‚Äôs biggest arts festival. 
It takes place in the capital of Scotland every August. 
It is 3 weeks long, and is utterly packed with events. 
Last year the festival was bigger than ever, with 53,000 performances! 
There are 300 venues across the city, but because Edinburgh is quite small, 
it‚Äôs easy to find your way around!

What types of performers will I see?
The festival is completely open, which means that absolutely anyone can perform. 
If you attend, you‚Äôll see a variety of different spectacles, 
from frightfully funny comedy shows to extremely energetic DJ sets and 
interesting plays. Before you go you should decide which events you want to 
see, as there is a lot to discover.

What can I eat at the festival?
Another reason to attend the Edinburgh Fringe festival is the food! 
There are plenty of meal options in the street markets, 
and don‚Äôt forget to visit the food trucks! 
You can explore the streets of Edinburgh, and find absolutely any dish you want.

What's the weather like?
Edinburgh is beautiful but the Scottish weather is very unpredictable. 
You will spend a lot of time outside, so if I were you,
I‚Äôd bring sun cream and also wellies - there could be a lot of rain!

How much does it cost?
You can book your tickets online. 
Some events are totally free, but most tickets cost ¬£10 - 30. 
The headliners and big names might even cost more. 
Accommodation can be incredibly expensive, so you should book in advance.

If you don‚Äôt already have your tickets for this year‚Äôs Edinburgh Fringe, 
what are you waiting for? 
It‚Äôs going to be even bigger and better than last year, and trust me, you 
don‚Äôt want to miss out!

Many texts use paragraphs with headers to organise information into small chunks. 
When reading a longer text in a foreign language it is often helpful to read the headings first, 
especially when you know what information you're looking for. 
Try using this strategy for the next few questions.

If you attend the Fringe Festival, you‚Äôll see a variety of different spectacles.
hard to predict

 frightfully funny 
It is an intensifier phrase meaning ‚Äúvery funny‚Äù. 
It is used in this text because the two ‚Äúf‚Äù sounds within the word sound good. 
Intensifiers in English can emphasise without changing meaning.

utterly packed... ...means very full of stuff.
totally free... ...means it costs nothing at all.
quite small... ...means not very big.

The festival is completely open, which means that absolutely anyone can perform.

------------------
5. Developing fluency - Use the second conditional

If I were you, I'd wear a suit.
"if I were" sounds more hypothetical than "if I was" and is more common.

We would invite plus ones if the venue were bigger.
If I had time, I would come to the party this weekend.
I would be at the wedding if I could.
Joe would know what time the wedding starts, if he looked at the invitation.
If I had another party, I wouldn't choose this caterer again.
He would visit his parents more often.
