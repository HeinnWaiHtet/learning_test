Ask the speaker to repeat themselves

Could you say that again?

He politely asks the speaker to repeat herself 
by saying "Could you say that again?".

Sorry, I didn't catch that.
"Sorry, I didn't catch that" is another polite way 
to ask for clarification.

Sorry? / Excuse me?
What do you mean?
We can ask "What do you mean?" when we want someone 
to give an explanation or more information.

Asking politely üôá üîÅ
If we say "sorry" or "excuse me" before asking someone 
to repeat or clarify themselves, we sound more polite.

If we don't say "sorry" or "excuse me", 
we can sound too direct or even a little rude.

Compare these examples. ‚§µÔ∏è

What do you mean?

more polite
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
Excuse me, what do you mean?
