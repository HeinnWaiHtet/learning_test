Chapter 7: The past
1.Past simple - regular
Form regular verbs in the past simple

to start
I started my first job when I was 16.

When we moved to Jaipur in 1996, 
I started learning English at school.

He talks about a life event from 
when he was younger and says "started" instead of "start".

to finish
I finished school in 2000.

My son Marley was born two days 
after I finished university in 2010.

"to finish" means to end something. 
The past form is "finished".

Here's a tip!

To make the past simple of most regular verbs, 
we simply add "ed" at the end.

to start ‚Äì started
I started school in 2011.

to finish ‚Äì finished
I finished university in 2020.


to work ‚Äì worked
I worked as a surgeon in Italy.

to stay ‚Äì stayed
I stayed in a hotel in York.

to visit ‚Äì visited
I visited my family in Kenya.

to decide
We decided to move to Sydney last year.

When I finished university, 
I decided to work for my dad.

"to decide" refers to making a choice. The past form is "decided".

If the verb already ends with an "e", 
we just need to add a "d" to make it a past simple verb.

to decide ‚Äì decided
We decided to stay in Canada.

to move ‚Äì moved
They moved to Brisbane.

I decided to move back to the town where I grew up.

I wanted to go shopping last weekend, but I didn't have time.

My sister moved to a new home ten minutes away from me.

I dated my ex for a few years.
Listen carefully - she uses the past tense "dated" 
because she is talking about her ex partner.

I walked home from work yesterday.
We moved to Las Vegas and stayed there for 15 years.

2. Past simple spelling rules
Learn how to spell past simple verbs

to travel
We travelled to Bristol every month when I was growing up.

On my 18th birthday, I travelled alone to see my cousins in Glasgow.

When forming the "regular past simple", 
if the verb ends in a "consonant + vowel + consonant" pattern, 
we double the last consonant then add "ed".

"travel" ends in "v", "e" and "l" so we add another 
"l" and "ed" to make "travelled".

However, in US English üá∫üá∏, we just add "ed" 
to "travel" to make "traveled".

to travel ‚Äì travelled üá¨üáß / traveled üá∫üá∏
We travelled to York last week.
We traveled to Utah last week.

to call ‚Äì called
I called my mum last night.

to stop ‚Äì stopped
I stopped studying physics.

It stopped raining an hour ago.

verb + d - moved
verb + consonant + ed - travelled
verb + ed - finished

to study
I studied at a private school in Hawaii.

Connor studied at a university in Vancouver, 
then moved to Seattle.
He studied in Vancouver and later moved to Seattle.

If the verb ends in a consonant + "y", 
replace the "y" with an "i" and add "ed".

The word "study" ends in "d" and "y". 
Change the "y" to an "i" and add "ed" to make "studied". ‚ú®

to study ‚Äì studied
My dad studied history.

to try ‚Äì tried
They tried to contact you.

We studied Korean for five hours yesterday.

My mum tried sushi for the first time and she really enjoyed it.

My husband stopped working because he hurt his back.

After I was born, my family and I stayed in Liverpool.

Our dad worked in a factory 10 minutes away from where we lived.
