Chapter 26: Parties
1. Inviting friends to a party
Invite friends and family to a social event

Can you make it?
Can you make it to my party on Friday?
When someone asks "Can you make it to...?",
they are inviting you to an event.

Are you joining us...?
Are you joining us for dinner tomorrow?
Are you joining us for drinks tonight?

Use present continuous "Are you joining" to invite 
someone to a future event (drinks tonight).

Can you make...it to drinks later this evening?
Are you joining...us for dinner next Monday?

To invite someone to a party, we can say 
"Can you make it...?" or "Are you joining us...?".

Can you make it to my Halloween party?
Yes! I'm in.

We can say "Yes, I'm in!" to enthusiastically 
accept a social invitation.

Sure, count me in!
Thanks for the dinner invitation! Count me in!

We can say "Count me in!" to accept a social invitation.

Here's a tip!
Two very common informal expressions you can use 
to accept a party invitation are "I'm in" 
and "count me in".

The pronouns ("me" and "I") can change slightly, 
depending on who is accepting the invitation:

Thanks for the invite - we're in!
Lucy says she's in for your drinks party!
Sure, count us in for drinks later.
Mike and Emma said to count them in!
Count us in for the party next weekend.

Can I let you know later?
Thanks for the invite. Can I let you know later?

We say "Can I let you know later?" when we need 
more thinking time before accepting an invitation.

to RSVP
Can you RSVP by Friday?
Can you RSVP by the end of the week?
The initials "RSVP" are from the French 
""r√©pondez, s'il vous pla√Æt" (literally: reply please).

Here's a tip!
If we receive a written invitation to an event, 
it might include the initials "RSVP". 
They stand for the French phrase 
"r√©pondez, s'il vous pla√Æt", which literally means 
"respond, please" and we should let the host know 
if we can come or not.

It's also common now to use these initials 
as a verb in spoken conversation.

Can you RSVP by Sunday?
Sure, we'll RSVP as soon as possible.

Don't forget to RSVP by 20th July.
"RSVP" means the same as "respond to the invitation".

Paul says "Can I RSVP later today?" 
as he doesn't know if he can come to dinner or not.

making an invitation - Are you joining us for dinner?
accepting an invitation - Yes, please. Count me in!

We use "Are you joining us...? to give an 
invitation, but "Count me in!" to accept one.

Are you joining us for the party later?

Can you make it to my housewarming party?
"a housewarming party" is a party that someone 
throws to celebrate moving into a new home.

Nicky called about the wedding ‚Äì she says she's in|she is in!

Yes! Count me|I'm in.

Can I let you know later about the party?
If we need more time before accepting an 
invitation, we can say "Can I let you know later?".

"invitation", but it might sound quite formal.

Would you like me to bring anything?

The verb we use here is "bring". 
It's an irregular verb in the past: "brought".

Here's a tip!
When someone invites you to a social event, 
it's polite to thank them and then offer to bring 
something to the event, e.g. food or drink. 
Often, it's not necessary, 
but the host will appreciate the offer.

two of our friends are vegetarian.

Yeah, I remembered that when I was at the store yesterday. 
I bought some veggie burgers and tofu for them.

Ethan:
Awesome! It sounds like we've got plenty of food.

Ethan and Donna talk about things they still need 
to get for the party.

Donna:
What about drinks? I bought some extra bottles of 
beer and wine too, but maybe some people won't 
drink alcohol. Do we need any more soda or juice?

alcohol-free options. But.... you know what we 
don't have?

Donna:
No....what? Oh....I know....We haven't got any ice!

the party.

4. Quantities
Express quantities with "much", "many" and "enough"

"How many people did you invite?"
We use "how many...?" with countable nouns such as "people".

Countable and uncountable nouns

Countable nouns can be counted, for example: ‚§µÔ∏è
ü™ëü™ë seats
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë people

Uncountable nouns don't have clear boundaries, 
which is why we can't count them. For example: ‚§µÔ∏è
üåä water
üçû bread

countable
Are there any seats by the window?
We'd like a table for two people.

uncountable
Can I have some water?

countable nouns
glass, seat, party

uncountable nouns
ice, water, food

Countable nouns usually have a plural form: 
"glasses", "seats" and "parties".

"How much ice did you buy?"
For an uncountable noun like ice, we say 
"how much...?" to ask about the quantity.

Here's a tip!
We can ask about quantities with "how many" 
for countable nouns and "how much" for uncountable nouns. 
Here are some examples.

countable

uncountable

that there's more of something than we need. 
Here are some examples.
