She lives in the UK with her husband and her children.
Nadiya lives in the UK but has family in Bangladesh.
 She has more than one child.

Her parents are from Bangladesh, but she grew up in the UK.
Nadiya's a woman, so we use the female pronouns "her" 
and "she" to describe her.

Sometimes I feel like I don't know the Bangladeshi 
side of me that much.
Nadiya's "Bagladeshi side" refers to the part of her 
family which comes from Bangladesh.

Nadiya has three sisters, and two brothers"

Nadiya travels to Bangladesh

small village near Sylhet. At the airport, her

cousins. And their children. They know she is
a famous chef in the UK now, and are very
happy for her.

Talk about the nature of your family relationships

How do you know each other?
Notice the rising intonation in this question. 
The second word is stressed in the phrase: "each other".

"Each other" and "one another"
We can use the phrases "each other" and "one another" 
to show a reciprocal action between different people 
in a group.

e.g. "Clara and her parents give each other gifts." 
means that Clara gives a gift to her parents 
and her parents also give her a gift."

Describing relationships
Did you notice we can use the phrasal verbs "get on" and 
"get along" to say that we have a good or bad relationship 
with someone?

We can use them to talk about anyone we know, 
not just our family, and they both mean the same thing.

I get along well with my parents.
I don't get on well with my sister.

Are you close to your cousins?
