1. Present perfect â€“ irregular verbs
Learn some irregular past participles

I have done the dishes.
I've already taken the rubbish out.

The past participle is not always the same 
as the past simple form of a verb.

There are some patterns in how we form them, 
but in practice it's best to simply learn 
and memorise each one.

Past simple form
I made lunch.
I bought the groceries.
I did the chores.
I took out the rubbish.
I was at home.
I went on holiday.
I had dinner.

Past participle

Jamaican jerk chicken

The Prepper

I grew up in South London with my Jamaican grandma 
who always cooked jerk chicken with peas and 
rice every Sunday after church.

She never wrote down the recipe, but after many months 
of trying, I've finally made a recipe that is just 
as spicy and delicious! ðŸ’ƒ

It tastes better when the chicken marinates in the 
spices overnight. To make it, here's what you need.

Ingredients
Â· 4 pieces of chicken
Â· 2 onions
Â· 2 garlic cloves
Â· a lime
Â· 2 chilli peppers (Scotch Bonnets)
Â· 1 tablespoon five-spice powder
Â· salt and black pepper
Â· 1 teaspoon dried thyme
Â· 1/2 cup soy sauce
Â· 1 tablespoon vegetable oil


to marinate
You can marinate the chicken with spices while grilling it.
James used lemon and herbs to marinate the chicken.
She recommends we marinate the chicken overnight.

to blend
Blend the ingredients in a food processor.
Use a food processor to blend some fruits.

to add
Add some water to the vegetables to make them soft.
You can add some salt and pepper.

to mix
She mixes the ingredients in a bowl.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.

that is ready to eat.

3. Explaining completed actions
Learn when to use the past simple and the present perfect

I've seen all eight Harry Potter movies. 
I watched the last one in English and in French!

We have made sticky toffee pudding for dessert.

The present perfect gives a more general statement to 
describe an action done at an unspecified time which 
has relevance or connection to the present.

The past simple describes a specific action that o
occurred and ended in the past.

Past simple
I went to France last summer.
I went to France last summer.

Present perfect:
I've been to Japan before.
I've been to Japan before.

I studied English at Penn State University.
The past simple sentence specifies what was studied and where.

I haven't done it yet. It's because I was busy.
I've already eaten dinner. I ate at Julie's house.

We follow a present perfect statement with a past 
simple sentence to provide more context about an 
experience or a state of being.

We start with a general completed action that has some 
effect now. We then give more details by providing 
when, where, who, etc.

I haven't had breakfast yet. I woke up late!
I've been to Mexico. I went with my mum.

I have... gone home and eaten dinner.
I... went home and ate dinner.

Have you had breakfast yet? What did you eat?
I've visited Wales before.
I went to Cardiff last summer for two weeks.

Tyler and Michael met at a gym downtown.
They met at a gym downtown two months ago and 
the two started training together.

Tyler and I (we) have already met. 
We met about two months ago at the new gym downtown.
Is Tyler the guy you started training with?

What did Amelia have for breakfast?
cereal with oat milk and orange juice
Have you had breakfast yet?

Have you had breakfast yet? Yeah, I have.
What did you eat? Cereal with oat milk.

I ate|had cereal with oat milk.
Why didn't you have soy milk? â€“ 
Umm... I haven't tried soy milk before.

Her dad asks a specific question ("why"). She gives a 
general statement that she's never had soy milk.

I haven't tried soy milk before.

why he doesn't want to watch a documentary.
He watched it two weeks ago.

"I've already seen it." general information
"I watched it about two weeks ago." detailed information

Use the present perfect to give general information, 
then the past simple to give more details.

4. Baking a cake

When baking, we usually have to follow instructions 
very carefully, otherwise the results might not be 
what we want!

"need to" and "must" (which is stronger).
