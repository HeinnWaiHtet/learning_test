2. Expressing desires with "would"
Ask questions and express desires with "would"

Would you like to see the specials?
We start a question with a verb, e.g. "would" 
then a pronoun, e.g. "you".

I'd like to get away and relax.
I'd like to go away for the weekend.

We say "I'd" as a contraction of "I" and "would".

"to prefer" means to want "one thing rather than another".

Did you notice?

While "rather" is followed directly by the basic 
form of the verb, we need to add "to" between"prefer" and the verb.

We can ask "would you rather" to give people 
options. This is a popular game with difficult choices.

Here's a tip!
To form negative sentences we put "not" after 
"rather" and "prefer".

In all other cases, we put "not" right after 
"would". We can also use shortened forms in 
various ways, as you can see below.

3. First conditional
Form the first conditional

If I take some time off work, I'll go to Spain.
If the weather is nice, we will go to the beach.
"if the weather is nice" = condition, "we will go 
to the beach" = result

Form the first conditional
We use the "first conditional" when we believe 
a future situation is real or possible.

Here's how we form the "first conditional": ‚§µÔ∏è
if-clause / condition (present simple) + 
main clause / result (future simple)

if-clause / condition (present simple)
main clause / result (future simple "will")

If I'm free,
I'll go with you to the party.

If you don't hurry up,
we'll miss the train.

If I cancel tonight,
will the hotel charge me?

If I'm busy,
I won't go to the concert.

We expect the result of being free is that 
he'll go to the party. If he's busy, he won't go.

If we visit Paris, we'll see the Eiffel Tower.
In the if-clause, we need to use the present simple ("visit").

If I check the weather, I'll know what clothes to pack.
Here, the main clause requires the future simple ("I'll know").

If the flights are delayed, we will take the train.

If we pack sunscreen, we'll avoid sunburn.
We need to use: present simple ("pack") + 
future simple ("we'll avoid").

Word order
We can switch the order of the if-clause 
(condition) and the main clause (result). üîÑ

Notice that we only use a comma (",") 
when the if-clause goes first. ‚§µÔ∏è

If it rains, we won't have a barbeque.
We won't have a barbeque if it rains.

If we stay in a hotel, we'll have breakfast included.

if-clause and "will" + base verb in the result clause.

both planned activities depending on the weather.

5.More verb patterns
Form more verb combinations

Both sentences talk about an action ("rain") that began.

Here's a tip!
There are some verbs that we can use with either 
"-ing" or "to + verb", with no change in meaning, 
like "to begin", "to start" or "to continue".

We can also say "we started to date" and "we 
continued dating". Both forms mean the same thing.

After the word "to begin", we use either "to fall" or "falling".

Verb patterns that change meaning
Some verbs can be followed by both the infinitive 
form and the "ing" form of a verb. However, the 
meaning can change, depending on which form is used.

Have a look at the examples below to see how the meaning changes.

(to recall an event)

(to be reminded)

(to cease doing something)

(to take a break from one action in order to do another)

I remember burning my hands when I did it.

The meaning of "remember" in the first sentence 
is different from the second one.
The word "remember" is used to remind someone 
and also to recall an event.

Please remember to use gloves.
The first sentence is a reminder ("to" + verb). 
The second sentence recalls an event ("-ing").

She stopped driving and went to buy something.
We use "stop to" + verb to show we ended one 
action in order to begin another one.

On the way home, I'll stop to buy milk.

to talk about ceasing an activity or habit.

I really hate eating greasy food.
She uses two verb patterns ("I like to cook" and 
"I hate eating") but the meaning stays the same.

Here's a tip!
Nowadays, English speakers might follow the verbs 
"to like", "to love" and "to hate" with an "-ing" 
verb or with "to" + verb.

The meaning of these verb patterns are very 
similar, so can be used interchangeably.
