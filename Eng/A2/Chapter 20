make them look like something or someone else.

My Star Wars costume is perfect for cosplay.

Cosplay is very popular at events like Comic-Con.

character from a book, film, or video game.

Sophie's Costume

Digital Learning Associates
Sophie:
Yay, I'm finally back! So the reason why I didn't make 
a video in such a long time is this. 
Or, actually more like this.

Narrator:
It's Sophie's first cosplay outfit. She chose a 
character she liked, and built the costume herself.

Sophie:
I designed this costume myself, and for those of you 
who don't know, it's a Twi'lek from Star Wars.

Narrator:
Making a costume like this is a lot of work 
and usually takes a long time.

Sophie:
I designed a built this whole thing in two weeks or something.

Narrator:
Not bad for a beginner.

Narrator:
Sophie really likes dressing up, but that's not 
the only reason why she decided to do it.

Sophie:
One of the things that I realised 
that I really love about cosplay is 
that it kinda forces you to learn new skills all the time. 
So of course, if you make your own costumes 
you will learn all these different things you need to 
learn in order to actually make the costume.

Narrator:
Drawing things on wood was just one new thing she learned.

Sophie:
But then it also teaches you about all 
these new things you would never even think about.

Narrator:
You learn the hard way, that if something doesn't work 
the first time, you can just try again.

Sophie:
Nothing ever works on the first try, like, ever, 
that just doesn't happen.

Narrator:
And if it still doesn't work, you have 
to find another way of doing it.

Sophie:
So, yay, I finally did my first cosplay and 
I actually designed this for Comic-Con Germany 
in Stuttgart, in June, it was on my birthday. 
People wanted to talk to me and take pictures with me. 
I absolutely didn't think that was going to happen so...

Narrator:
Yeah, she forgot to make a video. 
So what are we looking at? Sophie and her friends are 
on their way to Cologne for Gamescom. 
This time, she remembered to make a video, and 
she even participated in a costume contest. 
She didn't win tho.

Sophie:
It's just a very easy way to find people who share 
the same interests as you and it's just so much fun. 
But it was just a great experience and 
I got to meet so many awesome people so, 
yeah it was awesome, that's my new favourite word.

Sophie made her first "cosplay costume" to look 
like a film character she likes.
Sophie thinks "cosplay" makes people learn 
new skills all the time.

Drawing things on wood is just one new skill 
Sophie learned because of "cosplay".

People wanted to take pictures with Sophie in her "costume".

Sophie enjoyed Comic-Con and liked the people there.
She says the experience was "awesome".

exchange or return something from the shop.

Is there a till around here to pay for these?

done that online. 
Just remember to show the receipt in your email!

4. Revising for an exam
Watch a video about exam preparation

Episode 9 - Are you studying hard?

Janet:
You enjoying your time in England?

Leo:
I love it! I love the food, the scenery,
even the weather. Most of all, I love the people.

Janet:
Good. But tomorrow is your first exam. 
Are you studying?

Leo:
I study every day. 
I learn new words from Oscar, Anna, Georgina and you.

Janet:
Excellent.

Leo:
I have a question. What happens if I fail the exam?

Janet:
Well, if you fail the exam...

Leo:
What?

Janet:
You'll have to leave college. 
You'll have to return home to Brazil.

four things that Leo loves about England.
food, scenery, weather, people
Leo says "most of all" (more than anything else), 
he loves people in the UK.

Conditional sentences express the consequences or 
results of hypothetical or probable situations.

0️⃣ We use the "zero conditional" for general truths:
"if" condition (present simple) + result (present simple)

1️⃣ We use the "first conditional" for future situations:
"if" condition (present simple) + result (future simple)

Zero conditional
"If I win, you have to do my chores."
"If I study every day, I can pass the exam."

First conditional
"If you fail the exam, you'll have to leave college."
"If you practise speaking, you will learn new words."

If you fail the exam, you'll have to leave college.
Janet uses the first conditional and shortens 
the words "you will" to make "you'll".

Episode 9 - Are you studying hard?

Anna:
I am tired. I need a break.

Leo:
What time is George coming over to help us? 
(phone rings) Hi Oscar, what's up?

Oscar:
Yo, Leo. What are you doing?

Leo:
I am studying.

Oscar:
You need to take a break. 
Come and play some sport with me.

Leo:
Now?

Oscar:
Yes, now. What is Anna doing?

Leo:
She's no fun today.

Oscar:
Meet me at the park in ten minutes.

Leo:
Okay.

Anna:
What is Oscar doing?

Leo:
I'm meeting him in the park in ten minutes. 
Would you like to come?

Anna:
No, I need to study.

Leo:
Okay. See you later.

Oscar:
If I win, you do my chores for one week.

Leo:
If I win, you do my chores for one week.

Oscar:
1-0. When is your exam?

Leo:
It's tomorrow.

Oscar:
Are you studying hard?

Leo:
Yes, I am.

Oscar:
2-0. How often do you see girls back home in Brazil?

Leo:
Sometimes. Once a week, maybe.

Oscar:
You see Georgina very often?

Leo:
She helps me study twice a week. 
She helps Anna as well.

Oscar:
Hmm. Do you study at her house?

Leo:
No. Why are you asking?

Oscar:
You should study on your own more often.

Leo:
I do study alone but it helps to study with them and it's fun.

Oscar:
Game over. I win. You need to practice more.

Janet and Oscar use the present continuous 
("What are you doing?") to ask Leo questions 
about what he is currently doing and how he is feeling.

We can also use the present continuous to talk 
about future actions.

Below are some examples from this video. ⤵️

Questions about current actions
"I am studying."
"What are you doing?"

Statements about future actions
"I'm meeting him in the park in ten minutes."
"I'm going to fail the exam."

I am meeting him in the park in ten minutes.
Leo uses the present continuous to talk about 
his future plan with Oscar.

If I win, you do my chores for one week.
Oscar uses the zero conditional to wage a bet with Leo.

Leo sees Georgina more often than he sees girls 
in Brazil (but he may be lying about that to Oscar).

Oscar suggests Leo studies alone (because he is 
jealous), but Leo enjoys studying with Georgina.

Episode 9 - Are you studying hard?

Anna:
So it's countable.

Georgina:
That's right.

Leo:
I don't understand. 
I'm going to fail;. 
I'm definitely going back to Brazil.

Georgina:
Don't worry. I'll explain again. 
Countable words can be counted but uncountable words cannot.

Leo:
Thanks, I understand. I'm just nervous.

Georgina:
Don't be nervous. You are fine. 
Remember, after the exam we're having the big party. 
You must remember to collect your costume.

Leo:
What's your costume?

Georgina:
It's a surprise. What's yours?

Leo;
It's a suprise too. 
I'm so excited! That's enough study. 
I think it's time for bed.

Leo (dreaming):
Is it countable or uncountable?

I don't understand. I'm going to fail. 
I'm definitely going back to Brazil.
Leo doesn't understand what Georgina is teaching him 
and believes he won't pass the exam.
