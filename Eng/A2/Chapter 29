Also, have you thought about taking any medication?

3. The Imperative
Give instructions using the imperative

Get plenty of rest.
Get plenty of rest before your exam tomorrow.

Here, we form an imperative using the base 
form of the verb ("get").

Giving advice
We can use an imperative to give clear, 
straightforward advice.

To form an imperative, we simply use the base 
form of the verb, without "to" (like "get"). 
We typically don't include a subject because it's 
usually understood to be "you".

Get plenty of rest.
Drink lots of water.
Eat well and see a doctor.

Sit down! Dinner is ready.
We can use an imperative (like "sit down") to give a command.

Sit down and do your homework.
Here, the imperatives "sit down" and "do"
 are used to give direct commands.

There's a car coming, watch out!
Watch out, that box is really heavy.

We can use the imperative "watch out" to give a warning.

Giving an order or a warning
We can use an imperative (like "sit down") 
to give an order, usually in situations where it's 
necessary or expected that someone follows instructions.

We can use the imperative "watch out" to give 
a warning, typically when we want to alert someone 
urgently to a potential danger or risk.

Sit down and wait for your turn. (order)
Watch out, the floor just got cleaned. (warning)

Sit down and listen carefully. - order
Watch out, the soup is very hot. - warning

Please give up your seat for elderly people.
We can use "please" with an imperative ("give up") 
to sound more polite.

Sounding less direct
We try to use the imperative carefully in English 
as it is a very direct form. We can use words such 
as "just" or "please" to make a request sound less direct.

Just wait a minute.
Please be quiet.
Please don't be late.

We can use words like "just" or "please" 
to make an imperative sound less direct.

Get plenty of rest.
We can use an imperative (like "get plenty of 
rest") to give clear advice.

Get some sleep.

Sit down and tell me about your day.

We form an imperative using the base form of the verb ("sit down").

Please stop talking.
